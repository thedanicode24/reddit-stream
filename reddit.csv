2025-08-13 21:31:07+00:00,"Where I lived in my youth knife fights were not unusual.

In one case it was a matter of me and some guys having a disagreement. At HS. They didn't like the fact that I was from the wrong side of town and in THEIR school, nor the fact that I am mixed race. It was 1964. So they'd pick on me. I did not respond to name calling but when someone put a hand on me, we WERE going to fight. Simple as that. There were several. Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost. Didn't matter, whipping me did nothing. Because next time a hand was lid on me I fought again. So one day these 5 guys caught me off away from others on the school grounds/. Started to circle me with knives out and said they were going to teach me a lesson.

I am not especially brave. I was scared out of my wits. Because I did not know if they were just trying to scare me, or if they intended to really hurt me. What I did know was that if I waited for them to surround me I was screwed. Wasn't bravado, it was desperation. I carried a knife myself. In those days and that place probably 80% of boys had a knife on them. I lived in an offy neighborhood. I kept mine in my right rear pocket for easy access. A single blade folding hunter. I did the only thing I could think of. Whipped it out and charged. Thinking, really, I might be going to die. But wanting to get some of the other guys. The melee lasted only a very short time. Other students had seen what was happening and had called for adult teaching staff. I don't know how long, maybe only 10 or 15 seconds? Longer? I just know I was slashing and jabbing everything I could reach. Again, desperation ... not bravery. Anyway pretty quick several adults arrived and broke it up. I go cut several time but so did the other guys. Police were called. Well all ended up in a cell, separate cells, after getting patched up at an emergency room. I was only in that cell for a little while. Maybe an hour or two? But was then released as the cops got statements from other students saying those guys had jumped me. I did not see those guys again. The school expelled them, and I was told they did some time in Juvy. But don't know for sure. Didn't care.

The other time was also while I was a teen. Worked a neighborhood store, alerted my boss that some guys that had come in were pocketing stuff. He ran them out. They hollered back into the store that they were going to get me. They being the Lucas Rats, as they called themselves. Street toughs. And one night as I walked home from work, a couple miles, they were waiting along the way. Same deal, knives out and the leader started talking about how they were going to teach me a lesson. I didn't wait for him to finish talking, I'd feared something like this, and not only had my knife but it was already open in my hand, held so that my long sleeves hid what my hand did not cover. All I hand to do was relax my grip and it slipped down, handle in my hand. And I attacked, directly at the SOB doing all the talking. Got him and another and the rest were falling all over themselves trying to get out of the way. I'd totally surprised them. As those guys parted in a panic, I saw a hole and kept on running. I'm not so stupid as to think that I could actually win that fight. Not much of a fight, but I'm counting it. They did not bother me again. Not because they were afraid, cops busted them for some other things they did.

There have been other times I had knives pulled on me. But in a couple cases the guys found out I can run like a scared rabbit, and even better I could run further than they could, they just gave up chasing me.

Of course there was a time when 4 guys had me cornered, but in that case they just wanted my money. I gave it to them.",-0.9952

As much as Newsom is talking here, there's not exactly a ton more to squeeze from California.  And before you tear me down over the raw facts here, here's the raw numbers - 

California voted at a 60/40 ratio for their representatives in the 2024 election, and Texas voted at a 58/42 clip.  [Source](https://split-ticket.org/2025/03/05/what-was-the-2024-congressional-popular-vote/)   Given those ratios, and California's 52 house representatives, you would expect a 32-20 split, (rounding up for the dominant party.) In the same fashion, you would expect the numbers for Texas' 38 representatives to be 23-15.

The Actual results were 43-9 For California, and 25-13 in texas.

The House calls the vote to start impeachment proceedings and then the Senate tries the case and acts as jurors. Select House members act as prosecutors whereas the president would have their own defense team. This can be private counsel or, like Clinton did, also using the White House Counsel's Office.

Who is *not* allowed to represent the president is the DOJ. This would violate the separation of powers clause, be a conflict of interest, and an ethics violation. Assuming this was tried, Congress would be more than in their right to refuse to acknowledge the representation from the DOJ and have them removed from chambers.

Now, why control of the Senate would be important is you need 67 votes for a guilty verdict. Without having at least that many senators, the move is moot, because the vote will be mostly along party lines since that's what this country has turned into...

There's raw IQ

There's street smarts

There's specific industry knowledge. 

And you have to factor in temperament with all of these.

There are lots of people that are book smart and can learn and retain complicated issues but have little interest or proclivity to learn other tasks. So someone might be best-in-class in their niche profession but don't care how an engine works. Or don't have the natural skills to be a competent driver.

2025-08-13 21:34:32+00:00,"At what point does the oath kick in?  
For service members, it’s not about a gut feeling; it’s a legal threshold. You swear to support and defend the Constitution *and* to obey the President and officers over you, but that obedience is conditional: only lawful orders get obeyed. “Lawful” doesn’t mean “I agree with it,” it means that under current law and precedent, the President has the authority to do it.

That’s where this gets ugly. In D.C., Trump has an unusual amount of leeway. It’s federal territory, and he can federalize the D.C. Guard without asking anyone. Until a court smacks it down, that’s going to look lawful enough for most in uniform, even if it’s politically weaponized. And we’ve been here before, always under Republican presidents. Hoover used the Army to drive the Bonus Army, veterans, out of the capital in 1932, under the banner of “restoring order.” Nixon used federal agents and surveillance against cities and movements he considered political threats, wrapping it in “law and order” language while running COINTELPRO-style crackdowns. And now Trump is following the same playbook: declare a “crisis” that city officials say doesn’t exist, then send in federal muscle.

The point where defiance becomes a duty isn’t when you think it’s wrong. It’s when the order is *clearly* illegal, Posse Comitatus violations without an exception, ordering lethal force on lawful protest without cause, and bypassing lawful command channels in a way the law forbids. Then you refuse and report. Until then, the system forces you to carry it out while the courts, Congress, or local officials fight it out.

The oath is there every day. But “open defiance” only becomes lawful when the illegality is so obvious you could stand in front of a military judge and win. And history shows Republican presidents Hoover, Nixon, and now Trump will push that boundary until somebody finally draws it in ink.",-0.9583

The one that comes to mind is that **Megan Leavey** movie, based on a true story about a woman who became a trainer of military dogs and saved many lives. She's introduced to the dogs because she gets ""kennel duty"" as punishment for repeatedly messing up pretty badly.

The movie scene of the ""punishment"" was pretty funny for how obviously tame they make it. She sprays water from a hose at a comfortable distance and goes ""ew!"" and gags.

_________________________

I was stationed somewhere that had one of the largest military dog kennels in the US, and I know that this punishment was wayyyyyy worse in reality. If you got ""kennel discipline,"" there were 3 rules for the punishment:

- Had to clean the kennels of solid waste with only 1 pair of thin gloves. No scooper, hoses, changes of gloves.

- When carrying the waste, your hand had to be no further away than 2 inches under your nose.

- The wheelbarrow must remain outside the kennel building

It’s easy for one to dismiss these ideas. Often the response is something akin ti that’s never going to happen, or all politicians are corrupt. So what’s the choice then?  Sink to their level and become the same thing they are, the same things one would fight against, or perhaps just accept it, things won’t change, they never do. If that’s the case then why complain.

We can vote, not just at the ballot box but with our dollars when we buy things, with our time and presence at protests.

Yes, service members (SMs) are taught to disobey unlawful order, but who tf is going to decide WHAT is an unlawful order? You're really expecting average 18-25 years old SMs to decide what is or isn't an unlawful order? Good luck with that (think about how smart/informed you were at 18-25). Keep in mind before Covid Protest/Riots activation, they activated a bunch of military lawyers (yes, LAWYERS) to tell us what to do and not to do. If laws and regulations are so complicated that lawyers are brought in, you think 18-25 y/o SMs can decide when to defy orders?

Keep in mind the penalty for disobeying (lawful) orders can range from loss of rank/pay, hard labor, discharge (not honorable), to literally JAIL/PRISON. Additionally, a dishonorable discharge (unlikely to happen but could) is treated like a felony, you can neither vote (in some states) nor own a gun with a dishonorable discharge on record. 

Sure, if 10-15 years down the line a lawful order (at the time) gets ruled unlawful, you can get exonerated. But who is going to take care of your family during all those time?

2025-08-13 21:43:54+00:00,"There are many ways to discipline a child or teenager that is not physical discipline. Fear of consequences, anger, sadness, encouragement, reward, happiness, etc. are all emotions that can be reasonably employed.


However the reason that physical discipline is so offensive and detrimental is that it creates short-term fear and hatred toward the aggressor, but also models acceptability in using violence in human relationships. It often leaves psychological damage. I can send you scientific literature on this if you wish.


Taking, though, your 15-year-old brother example. Getting picked up by the police is already a consequence. There is already fear and sadness in that. You as a parent can already be using that as a starting point for a further discussion of acceptable behavior and setting disciplinary measures, without resorting to physical punishment.


Realize too that your brother at 15 was *already able to get married* in many US states. Assume your parents hit him for the police incident, do you also believe it'd have been acceptable for him to hit, or be hit by his (theoretical) 15 year old wife the following day? His wife disobeys him — As a 15 year old newlywed, he should hit her to make sure she behaves, just as his parents hit him the day before for his own poor behavior?

A hundred million things can go wrong for everything single other thing when it comes to intimacy and even sex can be less intimate if it's done casually, but when you and the other person just work, no amount of walls around your heart, mental blocks, or uncertainty can stop the kissing from being extremely intimate. If they match your emotional depth and feel the world the same way you do, that shit is gonna be BALLS DEEP in intimacy cause literally everything can be felt through every kiss.

They might tell you they're okay, but just one miniscule pause in a kiss tells you they aren't. You aren't exactly sure how pissed off at you they are in the moment, but you can sure as fuck gauge it by the kiss. They're excited as fuck to finally see you, and it feels like they're breathing for the first time. If they're horny, the kiss feels dangerous, almost volatile like you're being hunted. 

Kissing can be so intimate that if you have your head on straight, it can betray even the most fullproof of lies, lovebombing, or feigned interest. Okay sometimes it takes a while to get to this level, but I've always had kissing as a good metric of how far things can escalate in our connection and emotional bond or not.",0.828

The copulatory gaze, also known as the ""attraction gaze"" or ""intense gaze,"" refers to a prolonged and intense eye contact between two people, often observed during courtship or initial stages of attraction. This gaze, typically lasting a few seconds, is believed to signal sexual interest and can trigger an immediate, almost primal, response in the other person, prompting either an approach or a retreat. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Signal of Attraction:
The copulatory gaze is a non-verbal communication cue that suggests one person finds the other attractive and is open to further interaction. 
Pupil Dilation:
During this gaze, the pupils of the person being gazed at may dilate, a physiological response associated with heightened interest and arousal. 
""Approach or Retreat"":
The intense eye contact triggers a primitive part of the brain, forcing the recipient to make a quick decision – either to engage further (approach) or to disengage (retreat). 
Cultural Variations:
While eye contact is generally a universal sign of attraction, the specific norms and duration of the copulatory gaze can vary across cultures. 
Flirting Ritual:
The copulatory gaze is a key element of the flirting ritual, often preceding other forms of physical interaction. 
Not Just for Humans:
Similar behaviors, involving prolonged gazing and rhythmic movements, are observed in various animal species during courtship rituals, suggesting an evolutionary basis for this behavior.",0.979

2025-08-13 21:47:43+00:00,"the video contains at least one major error: 

all deserts contain plenty of sharp sand suitable for concrete. 

the video does not dwell on this error, whoch is good. the error comes from vince beiser, who has pushed this false statement around the world for years. i am very annoyed with vince beiser. 

for anyone who lives in a desert, two things should be fairly obvious: 

1. sand dunes (wind-blown not-sharp sand) are relatively uncommon; 

2. there are jagged rocky mountains everwhere, surrounded by freshly-eroded (in geological-time terms) sharp sand

3.  desert cities are almost entirely built from that local sharp sand. 

nobody is hauling river sand to las vegas or phoenix or tucson. the sandpits for the concrete that built las vegas are (surprise!) in the middle of the fucking desert. that includes the hoover dam. nobody mined SAND DUNES for that sand. they went to the base of the nearest igneous rock outcropping with the good sharp stuff and dug it out of the ground. 

there are some minor exceptions to this rule. are you extremely rich and building a very tall over-engineered skyscraper in a coastal city for other rich people? well then you can afford to ship in the very best sand that money can buy. this happens in dubai and even a few buildings in los angeles. 

are you hundreds of miles from the ocean in las vegas or reno or a military base outside death valley? then you are using locally quarried sharp sand. 

that's right. sharp sand. in the desert. every-fucking-where. 

there are some rather large dunefields in the arabian desert and the sahara. do you know what else there is there? mountains with sharp sand for the taking. 

do you know what the sahara doesn't have? a cheap way to haul the sand from interior algeria to anywhere else. so it doesn't get used globally. 

a factually-accurate video would point this out.",0.8002

2025-08-13 21:49:26+00:00,"Under the international law standard, you are correct.  But the US military has a different system.

International law is enforced by the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The US did not sign the treaty that set up that court, and does not recognise it.  It will not hand over people to the ICC.  Further, when the US negotiates treaties with other countries, they try to get the other country to agree not to hand over US citizens to the ICC.  They have that agreement with many countries.  So the ICC is irrelevant to the US military.

(The US claimed this is because the ICC does not give defendants a trial-by-jury, and the US constitution guarantees that right to Americans, so the US cannot agree to the ICC.  Whether you believe that or not is up to you).

However, under the standards set by US military law, disobeying an order is a serious crime.  Anyone disobeying an order will be prosecuted.  If the person who disobeyed the order can prove, in US military court, that the order was illegal, then they shouldn't be convicted.  But that is a very high bar.  If there is any way the court can interpret the order as legal, they can.  If the order was given verbally, there may be arguments about exactly what was ordered.  The court will likely focus precisely on the order, not the unspoken parts.

For example, if you are ordered to guard a prison camp, then that is a legal order.  If you suspect that it is a concentration camp where people are being killed, that's not enough to justify refusing it under US law, despite the fact that many concentration camp guards were convicted at Nuremburg.  You'd have to prove that people were being illegally killed.  Your word is not going to be enough, you will need paperwork or photos or other evidence.  And of course you can be prosecuted for stealing or copying that classified paperwork or taking photos in a classified area.  And anyone military who tries to testify on your behalf can be destroyed by the military, so may decide not to testify.  And you have to show the victims were not just killed, but illegally killed.  You'd have to prove that killing was actually illegal, and you know there would be some kind of legal nonsense to try and justify it as legal - ""they tried to escape"" or ""it's legal because Trump said so in an executive order"".  It is on you to prove it is actually illegal under US law or the US constitution.  And you'd then have to prove that guarding a camp where people are being illegally killed is illegal under US law.  Every step of that is very hard.  And Trump has a history of appointing judges who will rule for him, so it may not matter what your evidence is, the judges may find or invent some reason to rule against you anyway.

Given all that, refusing an order will lead to prison before the trial, and then is likely to lead to prison for many years and then losing your job and housing and losing your pension and all your other benefits, and a criminal record that makes it very hard to get a new job.

Whereas if you follow orders, you'll probably be fine.  Nuremburg only happened because Germany fought a war and was invaded and conquered by the Allies.  No-one is invading America any time soon, the US military is too strong.  The US government will back their people, and the President has the authority to pardon people in bulk, so could pardon everyone involved.  The President himself is immune from prosecution.",-0.9991

I think that there’s a lot of good people right now trying to date, but they don’t know how to communicate their feelings. I think good people have good intentions, but the outcome is bad. I think that people that are trying to save your feelings by not telling you how they feel when in actuality if you would just tell someone on the way that you feel instead of ghosting them that offers more closure in validity then just ignoring the fact. 

I think that two generations of people have been raised to not be able to feel feelings or communicate their feelings . I get the sentiment of what you’re saying and I understand that women are just as guilty as men, but that’s not the point that I’m trying to make. The point I’m trying to make is that people do not know how to communicate nowadays and they’re good intentions actually are not good. They are bad and they don’t realize it. 

I think that people get their feelings hurt because they get rejected and then they don’t wanna pass that kind of hurt on the other people and then instead of offering closure to someone they don’t because they don’t wanna hurt somebody’s feelings . At least this is my theory after 31 years of life. I would like to think fat people ghost because they don’t want to hurt you and they don’t want to protect negativity on you. 
And sometimes ghosting is the best avenue . Because people tend to like ask, was it me?  me what did I do? And a lot of times it’s not us. It’s the other person.

And I think the last five years I’ve came to terms with the fact that it is almost 90% the other person and not me . If they don’t like me because I’m overweight or because of this or I’m that that’s them and there’s nothing wrong with that. That’s just their prerogative.",-0.8634

2025-08-13 21:49:46+00:00,"For more context, in order to have UEFI SecureBoot enabled the BIOS checks the PCA certificate to see if it expired first. If it's valid and matches the expected official certificate, it allows your system to be installed or booted.

The original cert was signed in 2021 and expires in 2026, so they created a new one in 2023 that expires in 2028, when this whole problem will repeat again.

The problem is right now MCT installation media for Win11 currently does not have the new 2023 certificate installed. Microsoft provides a ps1 script to update it with the new certificate. However, if you do that and install Win11 with the new cert onto a device whose BIOS isn't aware of the new certificate, UEFI will fail with a security error.

If you look for a BIOS update there isn't one because device manufacturers notoriously give up on BIOS updates for devices after a year or two. And, when the cert finally expires, your device won't boot and when you turn to using an updated MCT to fix the problem it won't work.

Everyone in history had a life.  They had thoughts and feelings, hopes and dreams, they laughed at jokes and smiled at babies.  They loved fiercely, they hated deeply.

They lived through fear, be it wars, invasions, or even the fear when a loved one is very unwell and you're not sure what the outcome would be.

They were all children playing with toys, teenagers flirting with others, adults marrying their lovers, raising their children, holding their grandchildren.

They all had to bury a loved one at some point.  They grieved for them, cried when they missed them, smiled sadly at their memories.

One day, they were no more.  Someone buried them.  Someone cried over their grave.  Everything they ever were is now engraved on a simple stone, and time has passed so far that they have long since been forgotten, until a stranger reads their name and wonders about their life, their love, their family.

And that will be me one day.  I'll bury more of my loved ones, Someone will have to bury me.  All my memories will vanish, and I'll be another forgotten name on another dirty gravestone.",0.762

Not just “oh food is pricey” groceries, but the *sticker shock* of realizing that feeding yourself like an actual functioning human isn’t cheap at all.

When you’re a kid, you think the fridge just magically refills. Milk? There. Bread? Always in the cupboard. Snacks? Bottomless supply. Then you move out and boom you’re hit with the reality that the “weekly shop” you just did for $120 is somehow gone in 5 days, and you didn’t even make anything fancy. And don’t even get me started on produce.

You know what else blindsided me? “Staples.” You don’t just buy *food*. You have to get olive oil, salt, pepper, spices, condiments, coffee, cleaning supplies, garbage bags, foil, Ziplocs… the unsexy stuff that makes your kitchen actually work. None of that is cheap.

And the kicker? If you want to eat somewhat healthy fresh vegetables, decent meat, whole grains you’re dropping serious cash. Eating like garbage *is* cheaper in the short term, but long term? You pay for it with your health (and medical bills).

Yes, his daughter's diary came to light in which she wrote that showering with her father was ""probably inappropriate."" 

>You’d be an absolute imbecile not to believe there’s a long history of pedophelia with trump. 

Ehh, I tend to think not. Back in the day, guys had a saying, ""15 will get you 20,"" meaning 20 years in prison. Most men would ogle a young girl and maybe even fool around with her a little, but would usually stop short of doing anything that might get them in trouble. The exception to the rule is the people (evidently) like Epstein who had a real kink for the young stuff, who actively sought it out. I think Trump was a playboy and an opportunist, but I suspect he was savvy enough to avoid running afoul of the law ...  especially since the age of consent at the time was only 16.

We met shortly after my dad died suddenly. It was the first time I ever really cried in my life. I changed as a person and it took a long time for me to come to terms with it. I drank a lot and just didn’t handle it healthily, she stuck by me though. Then I lost my Mom, Sister (cancer) and my favourite Uncle (cancer) within 3 months a few years later. I had been making progress but I went down a bad path again. So for me it was opening up to people, not tackling it alone, knowing I’m loved and knowing I love people. I knew if I didn’t fix myself on a permanent basis I’d lose her and everyone I care about.

I’m in a much better place now mentally and physically.

There is an old quote about why you keep the police separate from the military. The police are supposed to protect people, and the military is supposed to kill them. That's why the militarisation of police forces and the use of the military as a stand-in for law enforcement is so dangerous; when the people become the enemy of the state, your state is no longer democratic and it's at the whim of who is in charge - and they don't just leave power willingly.",-0.9892

It’s meant as a socially acceptable way of saying I don’t believe you which is the same as saying I’m not open to new information.

And personally, anyone not truly open to new information is the exact definition of lack of intelligence. It screams knowledge grasping out of a desire to keep their ego intact.

I mean, don’t get me wrong, if you’re truly interested in new information and will actually consider the “source” provided not as a means of shutting down discussion, but as a means of creating meaningful discussion then power to you.

I love it when they can be themselves and comfortable around you.when you make it past all those walls and barriers , they can share trauma, fantasies, hopes, fears, and insecurities.  Deep emotional shit. 

I feel like that's a very big vulnerability.  She trusts you and is comfortable around you, and I love that and think it's sexy AF.  I feel like when someone can be open and vulnerable, and they have given you that trust, well, that's real intimacy.  That's a kind of soul sex. 

Physical stuff like moms who get stretch marks. Big friggin deal, those are battle scars.  I just call them sexy tiger stripes. Emotional stuff can be worse. Maybe she tells you some deep traumatic shit and you hold her while she cries and you make her feel better, maybe even heal a little. Think of what you've done for that person.  That's deep.

Only after I started eating like 3000-5000k calories did I start to gain weight. But still with working out I only gain like 3 kg per 3-6 months.

If you work in construction and are kinda high with similar genetics to mine it is not extremely unlikely that you might burn 3 k calories a day depending on how you live outside of work.

I currently work on an assembly line and also told myself that im kinda strong cuz i band or lift a lot of steel but only started gaining weight after actually working out.

I had a problem of telling myself ""ah I will go to the gym tomorrow cuz I don't feel like today"", so I just started to work out at home and I had no excuses.

To count calories I just used chat gpt.

For the newly wed example, thats obviously constitutes as abuse. Whereas my brother…he broke the law. A simple disobeying  is not equivalent to someone actually breaking the law. But then again you are right about the fear of consequences. And that can be a motivating factor. So that I agree with completely.

But that’s the problem with the fear of consequences at least for my family and how we were raised. 

This is my example: I got into a minor car accident when I was in high school. I could’ve caused a hit and run. But the reason why I didn’t run was NOT because I’m afraid of the police. I was afraid of my mom. 

So going back to my brother’s situation. He clearly wasn’t afraid of the authority. He too was afraid of my parents.

So what happens, without parental fear, what would u do if there’s no fear of consequences? How would u discipline my brother, a 15 year old teenager, without physical violence then IF he wasn’t afraid of the police?

Say you’ve raised him right all his life and he decides to steal all of a sudden and lied and hide from you. He wasn’t scared of the cops. How would u approach this scenario?",-0.9804

Back to the unrealistic scenario where a community's sole motive is to reduce risk, they'd choose to live in a place where whatever hazards they're exposed to are mitagatable. 

The point is that it's theoretically possible for a community to zero-out its disaster risk, but it's unrealistic, practically speaking. So we make choices - we compromise on things that increase our vulnerability because they cost too much or would otherwise negatively impact our way of life. Culture to culture, these approaches are pretty different.

2025-08-13 22:08:33+00:00,"Let's break that down some (and I am about to seriously oversimplify this): 

*""I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States""*

Defending the Constitution comes first: 

*""against all enemies, foreign and domestic; ""*

Still in defense of the Constitution, but now states to defend against both foreign AND DOMESTIC enemies. 

*""that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;""*

Those two premises still hold - defend the Constitution first against ALL enemies, from both other countries and within the United States

AND ONLY THEN DOES IT STATE: 

*""and that I will OBEY THE ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.""* 

So the way this is worded, your first duty is the defense of the Constitution, against all enemies whether American or otherwise. 

If the President is acting in violation of the Constitution, he would be considered an enemy, and therefore his orders to defy the Constitution (and its several amendments) are invalid, and can be ignored. If your superior officers are giving you orders that are in direct violation of the first part of this oath, they are also giving orders contrary to the oath, and can also be disregarded. 

As I said, I have greatly oversimplified this. But this is how I see that oath is to be upheld.",-0.6957

>you also don't know how to use ironic or scare quotes.

Considering I'm using them to mock your limited definition of the word 'intelligence', I stand by em. It's not my fault you're misunderstanding them because correcting people makes you feel better about yourself.   
  
You seem like you attach a lot of personal identity and self worth to your IQ, so it's probably really scary to have people challenge it as a metric.

IQ is one measure of intelligence, but not the whole story. Emotional regulation, creativity, adaptability, and even things like social reasoning or kinesthetic intelligence aren’t captured by IQ scores. I have a sneaking suspicion that this conversation rankles you because you'd score devastatingly low in each of those areas.   
  
If intelligence is our capacity to solve problems and thrive in complex environments, then we \*should\* be measuring more. 

>it's not reasonable at all to suggest that human intelligence doesn't vary or that human intelligence is not an actual thing.

You also have engaged in the logical fallacy of throwing up a strawman. I have not suggested that human intelligence doesn't vary, nor suggested that human intelligence is not a real thing. Where are you getting that from? Your misinterpretation of my scare quotes? Really proving your big-brain reasoning skills here.   
  
IQ measures a narrow slice of cognitive ability - typically logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and problem-solving under time pressure. It doesn’t capture emotional intelligence, creativity, adaptability, social understanding, or practical skills. That's without diving into the way IQ tests were developed with cultural biases and have historically been used to exclude and stratify, not to holistically understand human potential.

Saying, “only IQ matters, all else is silly,” is both *uninformed and reductionist*. Your defense is not based in reason. It's a defense of a particular kind of intellectual elitism.",0.9885

2025-08-13 22:11:54+00:00,"What is it that you think psychometricians do, if not develop, measure, and evaluate the efficacy of tests?

They would be out of business if testing was ineffective and meaningless as you seem to suggest it is.. .and it isn't.

I'm sure you can find some psychometricians who are unconcerned about the efficacy of tests and want to whinge about their perceptions of the fairness of the results but that's not the field or study that they're actually engaged in.

You sound like one of those science deniers that believe actual science is some kind of consensus or that it's ""settled"" in court or any other forum.

IQ is a robust field of study that has a 120-year track record. The US Army has been using it for over 100 years with good, replicable results.

Amongst psychometricians, there are no tests of any description for any human psychological trait that are considered more reliable and valid than the Wechsler Scales (WAIS or WISC) or the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales. 

You can certainly argue against testing anyone for anything on the basis of what you perceive to be fairness, but you can't argue validity, which is what you're doing.

If IQ is not a meaningful measure of what it purports to measure, then you can't measure anyone for anything because it's the gold standard of psychological testing.

Actual statisticians can actually prove this but not to someone like you who doesn't understand statistics or denies that you can measure the validity of a test.",0.6679

Well, I’ve known for years that everything was going to catch up with me, but today I had my second steroid injection in my left SI joint & I think it’s finally clicked that I HAVE to do something about this. The Dr pulled up the image on the fluoroscope, immediately remarked at just how far apart my hip & scapula are, and got a tech to show her. The gap is about 2.5x wider than it should be. I felt it slip about 4 weeks ago, just when leaning over & reaching for something on a door, no weight in my hand yet.  I have a connective tissue problem plus myasthenia gravis, and they basically just feed off each other. When your joints are unstable, they rely on muscles to support them. But myasthenia makes your muscles weak, sometimes randomly, sometimes there’s a worsening with obvious trigger. So yeah, PT gets really complicated trying to accommodate both.

This absolutely log head said, and I quote, ""We find girls attracted at those ages when we're that age too so at what point are we supposed to stop finding them attractive?""

When I opened the door, the hallway was empty. No footsteps, no doors closing, nothing. I figured maybe I was half-asleep, so I went back to bed.

About twenty minutes later, I heard it again, three slow knocks. This time, I got up instantly and yanked the door open. The hallway was still completely empty, but now I noticed something chilling. All the other doors on the floor were wide open, even though I had seen them closed earlier that night.

To this day, I have no idea who or what was out there.

California is a great state for the people that live in it not the people that run the government. His tactic is good as a distraction from his personal failures and the failures of policies, but this game of redistricting is nothing new, it has been played by both sides for decades.

I don't think anything he is doing is going to work out, his focus should be to make California a better state, and do that job well then he would be elected president based on his success.

2025-08-13 22:18:16+00:00,"Just jumping in to clarify a few things since there's a lot of strong opinion here that **doesn’t line up with the research.** I will provide sources for your high IQness to peruse. 

IQ isn’t a perfect or all-encompassing measure of intelligence. It primarily reflects performance on specific kinds of tests (logic, verbal reasoning, pattern recognition), but it doesn’t account for creativity, emotional intelligence, adaptability, or real-world problem-solving.   
  
That’s not a fringe take. It's backed by decades of cognitive science.  
*(See Sternberg’s triarchic theory, Goleman’s work on emotional intelligence, APA's report on intelligence metrics)*

Also, **IQ can be influenced** by environment, education, and early childhood experiences. It’s not as “fixed” as you’re implying. Childhood IQ can and does change with trauma, enrichment, or deprivation.  
*(Sources: Nisbett et al. (2012); Ritchie & Tucker-Drob (2018); tons of developmental psych studies.*

Also, looool. Saying people are “bitter” for questioning IQ as a sole indicator of human value kind of proves the point: reducing human worth to a number is reductive and pretty exclusionary. Intelligence isn’t just problem-solving, it’s also *how* we approach problems, connect ideas, work with others, or think under pressure.

I hate his deportation policy that has inevitably lead to people [trying to do it ""the right way"" getting sent to a fucking El Salvadoran death camp](https://youtu.be/DfTBhrkae74) and [people who are completely legal to live and work in the United States getting sent out](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/washington-state-employee-young-son-detained-by-ice-canadian-border/281-a2c9f151-800a-4346-812a-14f13328b6da). And the joke of it is, none of this shit is making the country safer since they're moving resources within ICE from [investigating crime organizations and trafficking to deportations to meet quotas](https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-ice-morale-immigration/683477/).

I've got friends with no criminal records who are American citizens. How can I expect them to not get caught up in this when [now they're actually moving on the ""denaturalization"" that Stephen Miller won't shut up about](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/trump-citizenship-justice-department-denaturalization/)?

I hate his policies regarding [LGBT people](https://www.aclu.org/trump-on-lgbtq-rights). I know people who are fucking terrified of losing their jobs because they've been out as trans for years. [Thank goodness my friends are mostly Army and not Air Force](https://glaad.org/transgender-service-members-respond-us-air-force-denies-retirement-benefits-to-trans-troops/).

I hate his policies on green energy--never mind environmental policy as a whole, because my God I'm not equipped to make you realize that man-made global warming isn't a hoax, but even in terms of [sacrificing American leadership on energy in favor of letting China win](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/climate/china-climate-united-states.html).

Need I go on? Should I regale you about my opinions on him engaging in bullshit vindictiveness against private citizens and organizations and states and cities instead of doing the job of, you know, presiding? Maybe we should go into deploying the United States military into cities? How about his blatant use of the office to enrich himself? His refusal to release the Epstein files? His absolutely ***fucktarded*** inability to understand the economy? His backing generative AI? His removing policies meant to increase the government's transparency?

Overstating consensus: You assert that “amongst psychometricians” there is unanimous agreement on the validity and reliability of certain tests, ignoring decades of debate within psychology, education, and sociology about what IQ tests measure, how cultural bias operates, and how interpretation of scores can be misused.
2. Conflating technical validity with moral legitimacy: You slide from “validity” in a narrow psychometric sense (does the test measure what it claims, within its own framework?) to “therefore it’s fine to use it however we want,” erasing ethical concerns about context, power, and historical misuse.
3. Ignoring history of racialized application: The U.S. Army’s early adoption of IQ testing, which they cite as proof of robustness, is also historically linked to eugenics-driven policies and discriminatory immigration quotas. Are you a ""history denier?"" 
4. Ad hominem framing: By calling opponents “science deniers” and insisting they “don’t understand statistics,” you attempt to delegitimize dissent without engaging with substantive critiques from within the field.
5. Universalizing from a narrow metric: The leap to “if IQ isn’t meaningful, you can’t measure anyone for anything” is not just logically weak; it’s a false equivalence that erases the diversity of valid measurement tools in psychology and education. It's also pretty stupid.",0.7529

Next date I went on, no nerves whatsoever. Fancy steakhouse just because I wanted some good steak for once instead of pizza and wine. I wore a nice flannel of all things, some good cologne, and went in prepared to meet another woman who would make me do all the work, despite being the introvert. Nope. I. Was. Enamored.

2025-08-13 22:23:41+00:00,"Even when my marriage ended my wife cared more about ""What's in it for me?"" than actually getting divorced despite being the one to ask for it. She told me I should just give her ""my half"" of what little I had ($3000) because it was hers by right, that she's ""legally entitled to it"" and that because she's a woman the courts would automatically agree with her.

She told me I had to give her the money because she was going to need it more than me due to having adjusted to a certain lifestyle and us separating would mean starting from scratch for her. Totally dismissed that before we were together she was living with her parents, when we married we lived with her parents, and when she ended things we were still living with her parents. Where is she now? Living with her parents.

She wasn't a homemaker, she hadn't sacrificed a career, we didn't have children, and I wasn't going back to some cushty life that I gave up for her, I had to return to my home country to live with my mother, get a new drivers license, a new job, new friends etc. but somehow in her mind ""You get to go home and just get on with life, I have to start over without you and with no support so I need that money more than you"".

She still hasn't signed years on since we separated. Why? Put simply ""What's in it for me?"" She knows I'm not going to give her any money, my solicitor has told me a court almost certainly won't grant any spousal maintenance order over such a great distance especially given there were no children or joint debts etc. so she's not interested in participating. She's spiteful and I wish that there was some sort of legal ramifications for the way she's held my life hostage all these years.",0.8651

2025-08-13 22:24:11+00:00,"I think you're confused. Instinct is not the same as impulse or learned behavior. We can disregard impulses, and we can learn different behavioral patterns, but survival instincts can render us *literally incapable* of conscious control of our behavior. They are reflexive in nature, like your literal knee jerk reaction. I'm talking fight, flight, freeze, fawn, and flop. I'm talking when your nervous system is genuinely outside of your window of tolerance, not when you're merely activated and anxious.

When under extreme threat you can freeze and be unable to move, no matter how much you consciously try. Your muscles go rigid and you become catatonic. Instincts have the power to disable the parts of your brain that give you conscious control. They can force you to flinch, withdraw, or retreat. They can render you unconscious or literally physically paralyzed. They can make you lose access to all or some of your memories, temporarily or permanently. Survival instincts are some powerful shit, and they exist for a reason. If your body thinks your life is in danger, automatic systems will take over, and your consciousness just becomes a passenger.

I know this, because I have lived it. I have CPTSD and DID from prolonged childhood abuse and neglect - the most severe form of dissociation and trauma. I've spent most of my adult life desperately trying to fight my survival instincts, without success. I've often beaten myself up for not being able to act when I've wanted to, until I learned that it wasn't reasonable to expect myself to be able to consciously override my survival instincts and take actions that my primal brain perceived as life-threatening (even though they weren't in non-abusive contexts).

That doesn't mean I can't heal from my trauma, or that I can't change my behavior patterns in a more general way, because I can, and I have. By processing through my trauma I can reduce how often and how badly I'm triggered. I can learn skills to help regulate my nervous system so that I'm less likely to end up outside my window of tolerance. And I can learn to be compassionate with myself.

But when I *am* acutely triggered, I can become literally incapable of moving or speaking. Like, if I try, my throat muscles will constrict such that I am physically incapable of speaking. I can try and sound will not come out. It's not an issue of mind over matter. The brain has a safety fallback it defaults to under high enough states of stress, and the only way to regain control is to lower your stress and find a sense of safety. I have no control over when my brain decides to switch me to a different alter in response to triggers, or causes me to have sudden (albeit temporary) bouts of amnesia. 

Believe it or not, but not everything our bodies and minds do is under our control all the time. That's just a fact.",-0.9971

It's okay to want to listen and be there, but boundaries need to be set in the relationship. If I had a chance to do it over with what I know now, I would just schedule a certain time, maybe 30 minutes to an hour 2-3 days a week to decompress and talk out difficult feelings and what I'm doing to make progress. After that, normal relationship activities and we'll deal with the heavy stuff another time.

Studies on this are talking averages, so maybe more people come out bruised and broken. 

And the expense is real, you aren't taking the same kind of vacations when you have kids as if you don't. Interesting perspective on empty nest though.

If you made a mistake or got distracted, you could lose an hour or two of work in a second. When I went back and visited years later, of course they had a system that was computer-based, not production hardware based. When I worked there it was “all or nothing.”

2025-08-13 22:33:56+00:00,"In college, I went hard into getting into shape, it became my addiction. I went from a 150lb ""skinny fat"" couch potato to a lean 175-180, 5% body fat gym rat. Then, shortly after graduating, my long term girlfriend and I broke up. My roommates/friends showed me who they really were (horrible womanizers and midly racist), and I fell back into depression. While I was maintaining my weight and exercise routine, I was using the gym to avoid social interaction and began binge drinking every. Single. Day. 

I would wake up, hungover (until I built up such a tolerance that I no longer got hungover. Perpetually inebriated?) , skip breakfast, go to work, eat lunch, hit the gym for 3+ hours, and then replace dinner with a protein shake and then begin to drink myself to sleep, often close to a liter of spirits nightly. This continued for 2 years. 

Then! My ex and I began talking again! We found that the breakup was truly due to a miscommunication, and we decided to try again, both of us knowing that we were made for each other through the whole breakup. Happily married 6 years next week, actually! But, in order to be with her, I had to move to the south. And even though I largely stopped drinking, southern food and portion sizes got the better of me. I was also adapting to a new job, and didnt get around to joining a gym the first year after I moved. Then covid hit. I started becoming more sedentary... and the drinking started again. 

2 years ago, I found that none of my old clothes fit right, I was easily out of breath, and I was having trouble sleeping. I began snoring so much, my wife started sleeping in a different room some nights, and she reported that some nights, I stopped breathing in my sleep. It scared her. So I got tested and found out I had sleep apnea. Got a cpap, and it helped, but I knew I had to make more changes. For me, and for her. I went to a doctor who cared. He did the works on me. Found out I had a bunch of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and my hormone levels and thyroid were way out of balance. I weighed in at 230, the heaviest I had ever been, and I felt sad. I'm on a thyroid pill now he says I'll probably be on the rest of my life, a vitamin regimen, and I have to inject myself with testosterone once a week. 

I thought, hey! If I'm going to spend all this money on pills and shots, and go through the trouble of being consistent with them, may as well go full bore! I stopped drinking again, started watching what I was eating again, and began my old gym routine. I couldn't believe how weak I had gotten! From doing weighted pullups with 65 lbs, to not even being able to do one chinup. But I stayed with it. 2 years later, I just weighed in today at 178 and I'm lifting like I used to! I have so much more energy, sleep better, and just feel like my old self! I'm 35 now and my goal is to lose 10 more bad pounds and put on 10 more good pounds of muscle. 

Remember, its about consistency. Not every day is a winner, and that's OK! Sometimes I still eat too much greasy food, or... have a couple nights of sad drinking (depression is a disease, yall). But stick with it! Once a routine is established, it gets so much easier. When you feel you're missing out on a part of y our day because you can't hit the gym or its a rest day, you know you've established routine. Anyone can do it. I belive in you!",0.9537

I imagine it will be trying to break up a protest turned riot where rioters begin genuinely attacking and overwelming servicemen and then someone starts shooting and at that point its not like your average conscientious objecter can just lay down their rifle and expect to be fine. Rioters will be frenzied and will be out for blood.

Thats whats so frustrating about all this. No one is respecting how things can slip out of control in the heat of the moment. And once lines get crossed then people just default to whatever their ""side"" wants out of self preservation. National guardsmen are paid to follow orders. Disobedience means throwing away their livelihood and often their social group. It becomes so much easier to just tow the line rather than stand against it.
