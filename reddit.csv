2025-08-14 17:13:08+00:00,"For long time night shift workers, you have to establish and keep a steady sleep schedule or you won't make it. Even on days off, you have to maintain it (obviously, there's some wiggle room, like ""regular"" sleepers.

After my dad retired, he took a part time job working the night shift at a nursing home. i told him that he needed to have a regular sleep schedule but he insisted on being awake during the days and sleeping at night on his days off. He didn't last long at that job.

Another thing that's crazy to me is when businesses insist on rotating workers through different shifts. The son of a coworker works a job where he is 2 weeks on days, two weeks on swings and 2 weeks on nights and then cycles back. I guess the kid likes it but it would drive me nuts because I would never adapt in time to the new sleep schedule every two weeks.

I loved working nights, especially when the shift moved from 9pm to 6am to 6pm to 3 am. I wish I could work that shift now. I have to admit that it would have sucked during the time my wife and I were raising our kids, though."

Everybody likes to think of themselves as ""I would never ever cheat"", but if you go out with a coworker that's trying to fuck you and you sleep drunk in a bed with them afterwards - you're just being shitty to your partner, even if nothing happened.

2025-08-14 17:14:14+00:00,"There’s a difference between believing there is hope for redemption and a knowing you have a guaranteed get of jail free card. 

Everything is going to be situational. If someone is having months long emotional and physical affair,  that is a fundamentally different kind of cheating than someone who fucks up and has a one night stand and that’s it nothing more. Neither are totally excusable but one is definitely a less severe form of cheating and more 

If the months long cheater comes clean, that’s inherently less genuine and more like playing their get of jail free card because they had months to reflect on their decision. Whereas a person who had a one night stand, reflected on their actions over the next week, and then came clean are going to appear significantly more genuine/remorseful and perhaps more worthy of forgiveness than the first guy

Now if the cheater knows there is 0 hope of redemption, then the one night stand guy may be more likely to either go to great lengths to hide their actions or continue cheating because the consequences will be the same regardless. Without any hope of redemption, you might as well go cheat 100 times more because you messed up once since the consequences will be the exact same for cheating once vs cheating 100 times"

2025-08-14 17:14:19+00:00,"Never said that all homeless people are on drugs. It is, however, a major reason why so many people become and stay homeless. 

If you have any knowledge of the legal system at all, you'll see over and over and over again how people refuse to get jobs, refuse to look for higher-paying work, refuse to prioritize finding stable employment over very sporadic gig work, refuse to go to drug treatment, refuse to contribute to their household when they live with another person, and refuse to pursue education so they can get a better job. 

Most of the people in the legal system are either homeless or are totally reliant on other people to pay the bills and refuse to make a serious effort to get a stable job and find a real career.

Whether you like it or not, the failure to care about the direction of one's life and failure to care about being a productive member of society is a significant reason why people become homeless. They just don't care to better their lives at all. I've seen this over and over and over.

Getting a good job does take serious effort. The reality is that most people simply just don't want to put in the effort to better their lives, and that's why so many people end up on the margins of society."

2025-08-14 17:14:21+00:00,">How men can harm women, children, animals, anything physically weaker than them. Men are supposed to naturally be protectors, so wtf?

I don't see the contradiction here. If men are ""natural protectors"", what exactly are they protecting their loved ones from? Other men, other women, other animals, who would do their loved ones harm.

It's funny, but to be a protector, you must necessarily be willing to inflict harm on things weaker than yourself... because things weaker than yourself may try to inflict harm on those you wish to protect.


...that being said, I do agree that macho behavior is stupid and has the opposite effect as intended. I see a ""big tough guy"" pushing someone around to show off his strength, and I have no respect for him."

2025-08-14 17:15:10+00:00,"I was nips deep in my slut phase when I met my now wife. And tbf for those first couple years it was pretty frequent. But when she had her manic episode and then started with therapy and medication so many complex feelings came up and it started feeling like she was doing it lovingly out of some sense of duty. I felt like another man that was demanding her body to display her worth. It disgusted me. We've been struggling with that back and forward for almost 4 years now. She tries and pushes herself and when I feel like it isnt her being there out of love the responsibility is on me to stop it and remind her that her feelings are more important and we can bang the rest of our lives but in a loving way not a duty way. We're not truly sexless, but likely quarterly do we have full sex.

That said to say it isnt a struggle would be a lie. Like many guys physical touch was and is a primary form of feeling love. Its an affirming way that im reminded that I am loved and cared for. Ive been in therapy for a minute and have realized the non sexual things she does to make me feel taken advantage of or dismissed which only compounds when I have to face that sexual frustration. So not only identifying these things but realizing that I have never let her know that these are needs of mine. So I feel like removing the quick fix of sex has made me do inner work to stand up and hold my boundaries else where. Its also made me realize how intensely ill shut down when I feel alone and how to express that without attacking her. Anyway next week is 6 years been together almost 10. The companionship is unmatched and ive never felt safe exploring my vulnerabilities while being in a relationship before her, so that really helps the struggles. At the end of the day were a team and I cant help bear responsibility for her psychological struggles so why would I make her bear responsibility for my sexual struggles? If it ever felt like we weren't together in these struggles im not sure we would be as strong as we are. If it turns out to be fundamental to me and I can't live healthy without frequent sex then we will cross that bridge when we get there. But I feel like progress is happening in this path."

I mean, he literally bought a hat from a guy, like off his head, and threw it down on the ground where he murdered his wife. He was willing to set up an innocent person, completely screwing them with making sure their property was at a crime scene.

I lived in the area and had friends and family working at Northridge Mall. Security was walking people to their cars at night after work, and extra police patrols went through. We were so invested in the details for obvious reasons.  

I remember when I heard the radio announcement about Dahmer and Anderson. I had moved far away from Milwaukee by that time, but when they said Jesse Anderson, I remembered that crazy week of heightened security."

2025-08-14 17:16:26+00:00,"I was going out with a guy, we'd been together for about a year or so and I really, really liked him. I knew he had bad anxiety, but was seeing a therapist and I thought was coping with it. He was moving house, had lost a diary or something (he kept therapeutic diaries then shredded them) and he was beside himself with worry about not finding it. I was like, eh oh well, I'm sure if someone finds it in the future they'll just chuck it away.

He then told me that he'd touched his friend's sister when they were younger, and I assumed if was some teenage hijinks. You know, felt a bit bad, but it was 2 young people fooling around. Nope, turns out he went into the room of a 6-7 year old girl and molested her in her own bed. He was 16 or so.

I broke up with him soon afterwards, told my supervisor (one of my clients was an adult survivor of childhood abuse, so I was reeeeeally quite upset about the whole thing). She said it was so long ago, I had no proof etc but I did the right thing in telling her.

Ever since then, a few things have made me wonder if he told me everything. I know some people with OCD get intrusive thoughts about being a paedo, but this guy once called in sick because he accidentally saw some adult porn on a Google AI thing. He also made a comment about his therapist being uncomfortable when he bumped into her with her kids. Or something. Anyway, yes that the most shocked I've ever been, and it made me feel icky for a long while as I am very short and young-looking. I also felt guilty and shit for being upset when it was someone else who was hurt, but I've never felt that 'switch' flick so quickly from loving someone to being repulsed by them."

Fascism by definition means: “A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent governmental controls, violent suppression of the opposition, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism”.

An example of a true Fascist government would be Italy from ~1922-1943. Not the USA now. 

The US is set up in such a way were a dictatorship is very very hard to obtain, which was the whole point the writing of the constitution and its supporting articles. 

The US is not BY DEFINITION, being run by a fascist sole dictator. Stop talking about nonsense you read online when you truly don’t understand anything about it."

It was so out of the blue so I told my best friend who also had a falling out with her. I wasn't sure if I was going to engage with her but we were curious what the ulterior motive was. I responded thank you and asked how she was doing. Her response was that her husband was arrested. Of course I shared this with my best friend before responding because we had no idea what it could be. He was a nerd and super nice. We concluded that it was likely DUI since he was a drinker. I ended up googling it and I found something saying his house was raided at 5am for CSAM. We did not expect that. 

Looking back things we thought were a little weird started to make sense. His wife perpetually tried acting younger than her age (also a Disney adult) and they were together since high school, he was a computer guy with a bunch of computers that she wasn't supposed to use, he didn't want his own kids and the reason was convoluted. The affidavit we found stated he was downloading it from the dark web. She was difficult to be friends with for a variety of reasons but she didn't deserve to have her life upended like that.

2025-08-14 17:17:30+00:00,">your beloved

This right here is the problem. A lot of ""beloveds"" aren't actually beloved anymore. The paradigm has shifted, and they're viewed as a burden, a chore, another (adult) child, another stressor of some sort. They're just another thing making them miserable somehow. Until that characterization changes, it's hard to fix intimacy issues. 

And social media (the root of many problems in modern society) does little to dissuade this. I promise I don't mean this in any kind of incel-y way, but social media is rife with vilifying men these days. Buzzwords that others have gotten from therapy, misapplied, bastardized, and said around have become commonplace. All of that ultimately serves to reinforce this idea that their partner is the source of the breakdown in the relationship, and justify refusing to participate in a cooperative effort to fix things until the man changes somehow. 

And don't get me wrong, the man may legitimately be doing something wrong. But it still takes two to fix a relationship, and effort from both sides, and a willingness to fix it. Resting on ""My partner is the cause of this problem and needs to fix it or I'm not participating in the relationship!"" regardless of gender is a failing strategy."

Turns out, in the late '80s and early '90s, he was a backup guitar tech and occasional fill-in for major metal bands. Not just Metallica, also Slayer and Megadeth.

The most stressful times in our relationship was trying to get pregnant because he has such low libido. It was a lot of stress and pressure on him. We haven’t had sex since I got pregnant and I literally don’t care. I’m exhausted by the end of the day anyway. Like I said - we both feel fulfilled and happy at the end of the day. It doesn’t bother either of us one bit. Of course would it be nice - yes but it’s not a need in our relationship. Sex isn’t the only way to show love and intimacy."

2025-08-14 17:19:27+00:00,Just come to terms with the fact you can't control another person. Your partner is a human being with flaws and life is long. No matter the remorse you yourself have to be at peace with yourself first. If you have enough confidence in yourself you can see this hurts a lot less unless you're just an arrogant fool and you're the master of your own undoing and because of that the partner cheated in the first place.

2025-08-14 17:19:28+00:00,"That's the conclusion she basically came to as well. I don't think she understands herself fully, if she's even a romantic type of person. What I'm starting to understand is, a lot of the romance aspect was out of obligation to ""be a good girlfriend."" When that was too hard to keep up, there was 0 sex life and I thought I was the problem (no communication and would freeze up if I even brought it up in a soft respectful tone.) in my head, we grew apart. Or she simply didn't have the ability of commitment after her previous relationship. 

Here is a link I found that helped me understand a little more, on what I saw happening in the relationship. She may have seen it differently, but she's not as perceptive: 

https://psychcentral.com/relationships/how-to-reconnect-after-growing-apart 

Her and I are not reconnecting, though. But if I was with someone who was willing to work on things vs be sad and throw it all away, this is what I would have loved to know 4 years ago when I presented the original issues I wanted to talk about."

For looks, pretty obvious, not everyone agrees on what makes someone attractive. For talented, there are thousands of things someone can be talented in. I might value a talented dancer, you might value a talented soccer player, someone else might value a talented pianist. Being smart is the same, some people are smart in math, some English, some biology. There isn't one objective truth that we can all use for a 1-10 scale. Everyone's scale is different, and that proves your point wrong. There aren't objectively good genes, only subjective. And to insist that a certain person has objectively good genes, and that people should strive to reproduce only those genes, is eugenics."

He got caught the first time, apologized, blah blah blah, switched parishes, people including his wife forgave him. Then he did it again. Same exact thing, he apologized, wife and others forgave him, and he moved to a THIRD church. All was well for a few years, and then he did it AGAIN. Wife finally said fuck you and left him, and the church he was a part of barred him from being a pastor anymore. Then he got Crohn's disease, moved to Vegas and probably did a ton of sinful shit for a couple of years, and then a year or so ago he was found dead in his studio apartment with literal shit EVERYWHERE because he hadn't been managing the Crohn's, either.

2025-08-14 17:21:48+00:00,"I have a few from my last job, where we had an in-house call center with 100 plus agents. 

They always had a hard time staffing, so some of the hires were beyond sketch. 

One day, my teammates and I were on a client call when all of the sudden a huge brawl broke out - the building had an open atrium and tile floors, so it just echoed through the entire place. Chairs were thrown over the balcony, wigs were ripped off, the whole nine. We had to reschedule our call because it was so loud. 

Turns out, one agent got mad at another over a hot dog and went home at lunch, picked up three friends and came back and jumped them. Needless to say, our building security was upgraded shortly thereafter.

Another incident also involved a call center agent - I was chatting with my boss when I noticed a bunch of cops show up in the parking lot. Of course I’m nosey as hell, so I get up and watch to see what was going to happen.

Turns out, one of the call center agents had broken into someone’s house the night before - the homeowner came home and surprised him, and he stabbed them to death. Then came to work the next day, as you do.

It was mayhem there while we had the contact center (the eventually moved it to another unit out of state). At least one person was LIVING in the building for about two weeks before anyone caught them."

My last ex, I was very attracted to and we were able to have a bit more fun since i was trying to waych less porn. However, porn caused me to have unrealistic ideas about sex. A mix between performance anxiety and porn is just not great. 


I havent watched any porn in 3 months and ive already noticed that im looking at women and think about having sex with them. My sex drive has gotten better, as well as my confidence. When I masterbate, I just use my imagination and I find that more rewarding.

I tell the guy ""no, sorry we can't open the till and make change like that"" he kept asking, and suggested he buy something to get the till open.

 I had politely told him no in 3 or 4 different ways, when my younger female coworker walked into the kitchen from the back. He quietly said to me ""wow, they hire them cuter and cuter these days"" 

That was it for me, I'd had enough of this non-customer and told him ""no, that's not ok, you can leave now"" he was confused and asked why? I told him ""I don't appreciate the comment you made about my teenaged coworker, and you can get out now""

His eyes went wide, and he started profusely trying to say ""I didn't know she was a teenager, I'm sorry"" at that point I was like ""dude, it's too late, you've made the comment, can't take it back. You can leave, and don't bother coming back""

**Became obsessed with noise music, gore movies, etc.** 

**On soulseekt & IRC all day. Came across a girl that was roughly my same age into the same stuff and we became basically e-bffs - chatted every day on AIM. She was bright, had a promising future. There were moments of romantic tension and remember trying to plot going to some noise festival with her and finally meeting but it never materialized. Around the time I was 19 and got my first girlfriend she got into drugs & derailed her life. Eventually lost all contact with her**

  
**Throughout my 20s I would think of her every so often & once every few years I'd try to look her up on social media or google but there was nothing, she was a ghost.** 

  
**When I did it this year I came across a federal indictment on the US Department of Justice Website. She is accused of running a transnational white power terrorist group, Terrorgram. She’s facing almost 250 years in prison - for soliciting hate crimes, the murder of federal officials, providing material support to terrorists.** "

2025-08-14 17:25:21+00:00,"Whatever works! At the same time I would say it's often fruitless to try and strong-arm motivation for ADHD folks. 

Enticing it usually works better. That can be adding something pleasant into an unpleasant task (music on your ears while doing a manual task), or roping someone in for accountancy. Doing as little as telling them ""I'm gonna do that now"" can help, because knowing they know adds weight to the outcome, even if they don't provide negative feedback. Making lists and breaking down big tasks into small items is super helpful. Make that list out in the open, a board or a piece of paper that's pinned up somewhere, so there's zero barriers to seeing it, and no way to close it up.

That's far from being an exhaustive list, and nothing is going to work every time. With ADHD you can only nudge your odds in a positive direction. 

It's worth noting that ""neurotypical"" people (at this point I'm doubtful that's actually a thing but let's go with it) do not strong arm their motivation either. They just have better built in enticement. They get reliable precursor rewards when they think about starting a task that's essentially ""remember how good it felt last time you did that? Here's a sample"" and more rewards throughout, and at the end. They follow a trail of feel good/feel right that leads them through the tasks they want to accomplish."

I didn't even know his birthday until I read his obituary.

My eldest sister, we've never been close. we did not get along when we were growing up. we almost get along now, but we are more long distance close. she's the ""only call on big days"" ( birthdays, major holidays) type, and I'm okay with that.

my older sister ( she's the middle kid) I get along with great. we don't talk everyday, but we do call frequently. we tell each other our secrets, and I'm close to her husband and her kid.

2025-08-14 17:27:09+00:00,"One of my coworkers passed away in May. He was only 27 and healthy, minus having arthritis, plus was one of the happiest and most sociable people I had ever met. Nobody seemed to know how it happened. There were all kinds of rumors such as that he died in his sleep, had alcohol poisoning, or that it was suicide.

Earlier this week I happened to find a police report. He died from meth. Never in a million years would I have guessed that he was using meth."

He’d pass our house and flash this huge ass, creepy smile like he just saw a ghost or invented time travel and give a slow nod as if to say, “Yep, I’m jogging backwards and you’re not.”"

Atwood then wrote a sequel in 2018 that takes place fifteen years later, called The Testaments, with multiple perspectives, and a very interesting take on Aunt Lydia’s perspective. I never finished it, but really enjoyed what I read and need to go back. I don’t know if June ever shows up in it, but I’m assuming she doesn’t. The book received excellent reviews and apparently impacted how the tv series would progress. 

Also, it’s apparently getting adapted into its own television show."

2025-08-14 17:27:41+00:00,"My cousin got serious with a guy she was dating and wanted the family to meet him. She warned us that he’d been in prison and had a past with gangs/drugs, but had been clean for a decade and was ready to settle down. 

He looked the part. Gang tattoos, shaved head, silver teeth. Looked a decade older than he was. Absolutely looked like a gang banger. At 6’3” and around 275, he was physically intimidating. 

That being said, he is absolutely the nicest guy. Very kind and respectful and obviously in love with my cousin. Cousin had been dealt a tough hand (absent father and a chronically ill mother, and an ex husband that abandoned her when she was pregnant) so to see her with someone that adores her and was so wonderful with her daughter just made us all so happy. 

He took administrative classes while he was in prison and has used that to work his way up to a supervisor position at a local hospital. He runs outreach programs at the juvenile detention center. After he and my cousin got married, he adopted her daughter and they have a little boy that’s almost a year old. 

People can look a certain way and we can expect behavior that reflects that, but Joaquin taught our family that people can change if they are truly motivated to. He’s such an amazing guy and my cousin is so happy. They deserve all the good things in the world."

True, however to be a true protector you have to with-hold harming a weaker thing unless it becomes a threat. 

A man deciding to r\*pe a woman he sees getting off a bus does not see her as a ""threat"" and has to do that to her to protect himself or others. He does it because he wants to. 

A man beating his wife daily does not see her as a threat to himself, he does it because he wants to/cannot control himself. 

I can understand your point of harming something/someone weaker than a man to protect those he cares for, but I am talking about regular everyday harm which many men unfortunately do (I am not bashing men or saying all men do these things). 

I also know that women can harm weaker men/children/animals and I don't agree with that either however it is more prevalent in men to do so and I just don't understand why."

2025-08-14 17:30:14+00:00,"My family has a small horse farm and we travel around the country to different equestrian riding spots. At the time, we had a close knit group of friends that we’d travel with all the time. There were about 6-12 couples in the group at any given time, and you know how that goes - you’re going to absolutely adore some of them, but there’s always one or two people you aren’t all crazy about. One of the men always made me feel uncomfortable: he’d met his wife (such a sweet woman) overseas while he was in the military, she was always incredibly subservient to him, called him “Daddy” (just ICK), and she wasn’t allowed to do anything on her own except go to work. I always jokingly (but serious) told my husband that that guy was someone I’d never want to get stuck in an elevator with. He just creeped me TF out. One day, without warning, this couple suddenly packed up, sold their house, and moved to another state, saying they’ve just always wanted to live there. I called bullshit on the whole thing because they were enormously entrenched where they lived and in all the time we’d spent with them, they’d never mentioned moving. Moreover, they were so tight lipped about all of it, I knew something was up. (The wife was not allowed to talk about it to anyone, and I remain convinced that she never knew the whole truth).

Fast forward to a couple of years later: I was visiting a relative and we’d returned home from dinner. We sat down on the couch and turned the TV on while we chatted about our day. That’s when I heard his voice. I turned to the TV to see that man on security camera footage. He was being featured on a prime time special because apparently, in his capacity as a security guard for a woman’s prison, he was (allegedly) sexually assaulting and thoroughly mistreating prisoners.

The whole sudden relocation to a different state with all the secrecy made sense, as he and the prison were being sued. I don’t know if he was attempting to evade detection, or thought he would wait it out until everything quieted down, but there he was on fucking prime time TV. I have no doubt *at all* that every allegation, and likely more we’ll never know about, are/were entirely true. He was 100% a sexual predator taking full advantage of his position over these women for his own twisted gratification. PIG.

2025-08-14 17:30:56+00:00,"I don't know if it's the ""most shocking"", but definitely shocking to me and something that I still struggle with..   

My ex and I were together for over 20 years - I grew up really poor and in a less than ideal house.  My dad died when I was young and my mom took off with a guy she met on the internet.  My ex and I started dating (the first time) when I was 18 or so.  I chased her for years and eventually started dating, moving in together, etc..   Her dad was a doctor and they were pretty well-off, and immediately took me in as one of their own.  Her dad and I got along great - I looked at him like a father figure.   He could be pretty demanding, but I always made myself available for anything he wanted or needed - I helped him with car projects, home remodels, trips - I took off work when they came to town, anything - you name it.  

My ex cheated a couple years after we moved to a new town to continue school.   We split up for 2 years and during that time, I would occasionally drive back to our old town, just to see her parents, maybe grab lunch with them or something.  We got back together and a couple years later, I had my suspicions about her cheating again, but never proved anything - I always told her that I'd forgiven her once, if she did it again, we were done.  

Finally, during the summer of 2020, Covid and all of that -she basically went bonkers.  Started drinking extremely heavily, partying and took off to her parents lake house for weeks at a time.  I found out that she'd been having an affair with a guy she'd met at some sketchy bar and with that, we were done.   The morning she came clean (she'd passed out the night before and I saw all these texts come through on her phone) we had a long, very emotional talk and I said I was leaving.  Additionally, I had been paying for her phone under my plan.  I told her I'd be canceling her phone, as I wasn't going to pay for her to talk to her boyfriend.  She asked if she could call her parents really quick, just to explain and tell them she may be without a phone for a few hours.  

I was upstairs, putting some things in a bag and trying to figure out where I would go when I heard her on speaker telling her dad that we were done - she'd been seeing a guy and I found out.  I hear her dad say (and I'll remember it forever), ""Good.   I always told you I never liked him.  I always told you you could do better.""  

Man, that shit hurt worse than her cheating.  He was seriously like a dad to me.  They were basically the only family I'd known - I loved him and thought he loved me.  And to hear that he'd apparently never liked me?  Damn.."

If it isn't happening, you can either turn the relationship into one based on non-erotic love, which people do find success with, or you two can split up. And that's sometimes what you just need to accept. I'd also say that some people do find happiness by maintaining a loving relationship while finding erotic satisfaction elsewhere in open relationships, but those require a strong amount of introspection and open/honest communication with current partner and any others that would be considered."

I never implied that.  I was responding directly to your claim:

If you actually meant to say ""Working hard is likelier than not to improve a person's life,"" maybe you should've said that instead because that's a very different claim than ""most people who work hard will have a better life than those who don't.""  Are you confused about the difference between those two statements?

2025-08-14 17:31:58+00:00,"Maybe twenty or so years ago, I had a flight connection in Milan Malpensa airport.  At the time, it was one of those airports where the planes didn't come to the gates--you'd get on a bus that would take you out to the plane.  So there was a waiting area, and then there were escalators that went down from there.

When my flight number came up, I followed the signs to the escalator that went down to get the bus.  Only it didn't go down to the bus--it went down to a little area by the doors out to where the buses would come pick you up.  Only the thing was, you couldn't see that area from the top of the escalator, so by the time I realized that the doors were closed, and that little area was filling up, I couldn't turn around or anything--just had to go down further, into the gradually increasing press.  As did everyone who got on the escalator after me.

Fortunately, they did open the doors before people started getting crushed to death, but this did not strike me as an optimally designed system.

In retrospect, I do sort of wonder if ""Malpensa"" is Italian for ""poorly thought out."""

2025-08-14 17:33:10+00:00,"Honestly, it’s complicated, and there’s no one-size-fits-all. But a lot of it comes down to a few things:

First, having people around who actually support you makes a huge difference. If you’ve got friends, family, or even just someone to talk to who really listens, it can help you feel less alone and more able to handle what happened.

Second, how someone copes matters a lot. Some people find healthy ways to deal like therapy, writing, exercise, or just talking it out. Others might get stuck in bad habits or push feelings away, which makes it harder to heal.

Also, personality plays a part. Some folks are naturally more optimistic or able to adapt when life throws curveballs, while others find it way tougher. But that stuff can be learned over time, too.

Then there’s the kind of trauma itself. A single hard event might be easier to move past than years of ongoing pain or abuse. Plus, things like money, access to therapy, and a safe environment can make healing easier or harder.

And don’t forget biology how our brains and bodies react to stress isn’t the same for everyone.

At the end of the day, resilience isn’t about “being strong” or “tough.” It’s about getting through in your own way and time. Some people bounce back faster, some take years, and that’s totally okay. It’s a messy process, but healing is possible."

2025-08-14 17:34:13+00:00,"It can work in certain contexts if it comes across as funny. I remember when I was on Tinder and a lot of girls were soliciting pickup lines in their bios. But there's no way to deliver one of these if you're trying to be sauve. 

But in general, your goal shouldn't be to come across as sauve. You want women to feel like you're safe and fun and interesting. A cheesy pickup line, delivered well in the right context, can be an icebreaker that shows interest in a fun but low-stakes way.

As am aside... A lot of unsuccessful men think they fail with women because they're insufficiently masculine. That if they came across more like James Bond or some literally-me Ryan Gosling character that they'll attract interest. But modelling yourself after violent withdrawn sociopaths makes yourself come across as one."

I think for a lot of people, porn can be like that too. You stop for a while - you're in a relationship, life gets busy, you find an engaging hobby, whatever - and life keeps going. It doesn’t really have a huge “impact”.

2025-08-14 17:35:11+00:00,"This is a long one, forgive me, there's not really an adequate way to summarize this other than ""it depends"" .

If this is a short term relationship, under a year as an example, I would forgive them, but I'm not staying with them.

If this was someone who I've spent years building an emotional connection with, shared highs, and lows, spent countless hours with, opened up to, built rapport and trust with, then no.

Genuine remorse in a situation like that is a means of trying to obtain absolution to relieve themselves of the gut wrenching guilt that they *should* feel.

There are only two scenarios in which I could ever consider providing that absolution:

1. They fall out of love with me. Either through my own emotional, or physical neglect of them, or just from the passage of time taking its toll, but they didn't know how to approach me about it, or were scared of how it would hurt me.

-- This one is a little nuanced, but I've seen this scenario before and it sucks for everyone involved. The cheater was absolutely wracked with guilt. They had fallen out of love with their partner and didn't know how to tell them because their partner was having a really difficult time in their life with parents dying very close together, being fired from their job. That person did not take the news well and berated the cheater to the point where the additional guilt caused the cheater to take their own life. 

2. It was a mutually agreeable open relationship and they didn't tell me about a hookup."

2025-08-14 17:36:31+00:00,"Sure, it’s easy to roll your eyes at “taking my shoes off at the airport,” but 9/11 reshaped global security for a reason. The intel and counter-terrorism systems built after it stopped dozens of credible plots like the 2001 shoe bomber, the 2006 UK liquid explosives plan, and several attempted hijackings in Europe. Without those measures, we’d likely have had more mass casualty attacks in the 2000s. And yes, the wars had oil politics in the background, but they also dismantled Al-Qaeda’s largest base of operations. You don’t have to agree with all the decisions made, but pretending the day wasn’t a turning point in modern history just isn’t based in fact. And yes we probably would have had more security measures put in place later on but it prevented attacks that could have been catastrophic if not for 9/11 happening. But I don’t just think it was one thing that “changed the world” I think it’s multiple things and in my opinion 9/11 was the thing that changed the world around in ways."

There are people (usually female) who know me in real life to joke a lot but then get offended when I joke in text then I have to leave a voice note explaining that I am joking then I stop joking with those people because It's not fun. 

Some people can't get tone from a message without a voice while others require a video where they can see your face to know that you're joking despite knowing that you joke all the time when you're face to face. It's confusing but it's how it is.

Ps: Calm down, I didn't write ""female"" to start anything. There have literally been about three males that I have had to explain it to in my life while the female count is well over ten. It is my personal experience."

The problem is that an individual house's value is partially determined by its neighbors, so what recourse would someone have if their neighbors ruined the property values? The issue is that HOAs are given too much power almost by necessity and can be run by power-hungry pissants with no oversight. I also don't know what percentage of HOAs are actually the ones that make every other HOA look bad. Stories of neutral or good HOAs don't propagate in the zeitgeist as well or easily as the nastiest kind, and singular anecdotal evidence can just be told by the person whose actually the problem."

He was genuinely remorseful, did everything right after I found out (I have complete access to all financial and social media accounts as well as email and his phone and computer) and our marriage is actually better than it was before in certain ways.  Had he not been upfront, honest, remorseful, etc. I would be divorced.

2025-08-14 17:37:33+00:00,"This a moral-credential bias, or moral licensing.  

You give yourself permission to engage in morally questionable behaviour or actions because you’ve previously acted in a morally upright or virtuous manner. 

You do something good, kind or beneficial, then feel justified in doing something bad, dishonest or illegal. 

It stems from the desire to maintain a positive self-image and to resolve cognitive dissonance. By having a track record of moral behaviour, you feel you’ve earned the right to do something immoral. You’ve ‘balanced the scales’

This bias allows individuals to engage in harmful or unethical behaviour while still perceiving themselves as moral and virtuous."

2025-08-14 17:38:46+00:00,"When I was a kid my mom married this guy when I was around 9. Great dude, he was fun to be around and felt like the big brother I'd never had. Everything was great and they were happy. 

Then one day my mom came home from work early. There was a message on their answering machine from the bank regarding their house being in foreclosure. My mom had no clue. He'd handled a lot of their finances and this was back before online banking and things like that. My mom spent the afternoon on the phone figuring out what had happened. Their house was in foreclosure, my mom's house she'd been renting out was in foreclosure, they were behind on all their bills, all of their money was gone, checks had bounced everywhere, and they owed money to the IRS as well. My mom was financially DESTROYED and she had no idea about any of it. When he got home she gave him a choice: come clean or leave. He left and we never saw him again. 

A few years after all that happened my mom got a call from a sheriff in Nevada asking if she knew of her ex husband's whereabouts. She had no clue; in fact it had been difficult for her to get a divorce because she couldn't track him down to sign the papers. Anyway, turns out he was wanted for kidnapping. He'd shacked up with a new lady who had a kid that she didn't have custody of. When the kid was visiting, the two of them took off with the kid. 

Fortunately, the lady eventually felt guilty and there were some abuse allegations regarding my ex stepdad so she turned herself in and the kid was returned to his dad. But it was very surreal thinking that this guy who had once seemed so great and awesome and everything had turned out to be the complete opposite."

2025-08-14 17:38:47+00:00,"Apologies for this very long response, but one of those moments where a reddit comment really strikes a chord and you feel the need to reply at length and in earnest. 

I'm asexual and 8 years into a marriage not totally dissimilar to yours. I wouldn't ever prescribe that label to your wife/anyone else, but I feel generally similar to how it sounds like she does that I could basically just completely forget about what for other people is a ""need"" if left to my own devices, and that when we do engage I feel a lot of guilt over not ""really"" feeling into it in a way where the experience is fulfilling for them anyway. 

We've been together for 16 years, and for a long time until internet awareness of that label found me, we both experienced a lot of shame and unhappiness around our sex lives despite being very happy and compatible in the entire rest of our relationship; it felt bad/dishonest for me to ""fake"" being into it when we had sex, but it made them feel bad/unwanted/unskilled when I was inevitably *not* truly into it, made me feel bad/damaged/inadequate for not being able to fulfill that need for them, made them feel bad/like a bad *person* for ""pressuring"" me for (literally just in asking at all ever)/wanting sex when I clearly was just mostly humoring/tolerating the experience. Because the entire thing was so fraught when we did engage with it, they mostly stopped trying to ever initiate since I seemed(/was) happiest when it just didn't come up, and why jeopardize such a good thing over something so ""trivial?""

I wish we'd talked about it much sooner. 

I empathize a lot with what you're expressing, but I just wanted to push back specifically on ""my wanting sex while she has no interest... is a moral failing I must overcome."" 

You are being far too hard on yourself. Your desires and needs are also important in this equation; this is a situation where it's entirely possible for *nobody to be the bad guy.* I'm definitely also not saying that there needs to be a ""compromise"" where she *does* have sex ""for"" you — you may end up at the exact same conclusions (as I said, what you describe is similar to how our relationship *does* mostly function now, though we've discussed multiple times the possibility/permission for my spouse to find their jollies elsewhere without otherwise altering our arrangement, they've just ultimately never felt like pursuing that path because they value what we have and don't want to risk messing with it) — but it is *not* in any way a moral failing on your part to still *want* or feel like you need sex even though you know your wife doesn't, and it's actively self-harmful for you to be feeling guilt and shame over that extremely natural human urge. That type of self-denial can ultimately lead to resentment in a relationship, even unintentionally/subconsciously. Neither of you is in the wrong for wanting what you want and feeling how you feel!

I hear echoes in what you're saying that *hurt* to hear, because of the conversations we eventually did have where my spouse admitted that they often felt like they were essentially committing assault when they proposed Sexy Times and I said ""yes,"" and how awful that made them feel as a person to be willing to do that ""just"" for their own gratification. They also said this dynamic made them feel like they fundamentally couldn't trust that I would actually say ""no"" or ""stop"" if something *wasn't* OK with me — something I think they *were correct about.*

We're both far from perfect communicators IRL, and this was all really messy to work through at the time. The first couple times we did try to talk about it, *all* I could hear was that I was hurting them by making them feel that way and needed to do a better job initiating/performing my half of meeting their needs. But we did keep talking about it over time, because we both really respect each other and value each other's thoughts and feelings, and it was really worth it in the end; discussing it frankly and hashing out the dynamics going on eventually healed so much guilt and inadequacy we had both felt in various facets of our relationships, and even lives. 

Until really examining it and struggling to articulate it, I don't think I really *had* fully realized how different my experience of (not particularly) feeling sexual attraction was from how it is for most other people, because there are so many background social/cultural assumptions at play (especially re: the expectations around women's relationship to enjoying sex) that I had never bothered to literally ask other people, ""how does desire/sex feel for you."" I obviously can't say what conclusions your wife may come to — there are a lot of things besides asexuality that can cause someone to not be interested in having sex, they're related but not the same — but it's worth it to find out. If it's possible to reassure her that this line of interrogation is truly just for mutual understanding and self-discovery, it's a worthwhile bear to poke, I promise. 

The absolutely best thing it lead to was that there actually was a lot of non-sexual intimacy being left on the table that we were *both really missing,* because I didn't want to ever ""lead them on""/wind them up when that type of affection wasn't ""going anywhere"" and they didn't really know (tbf neither did I) where exactly my boundaries around discomfort with the experience started. Your wife sounds like she's generally more sex-averse than I am/was (I never had pain/*dis*pleasure related to it), and everyone's experiences with such things are unique — I don't wanna mislead anyone into thinking any one outcome is likely — but at least for me, ironically, being able to finally be on the same page about what I was(/n't) feeling actually made me way *more* willing to engage in sexual intimacy on my own terms as well. I could initiate spoiling my partner with a ""giving"" experience when the rare mood did strike me without them feeling weird/bad/inadequate/unwanted that I really did not want anything reciprocal, and they could finally trust that they could ask if I was amenable to that type of intimacy at a given moment and I would say ""no"" if I wasn't, because I could finally feel confident in my end that ""no"" would be OK as an answer even if was genuinely every time. 

**Tl;dr: I think the conclusions of your arrangement are ultimately fine for a perfectly *functional* relationship, but you're missing out on the potential for an even closer and more honest connection if you can seek answers while making it clear you're not looking for ""solutions"" to your lack of sexual intimacy. It's awesome that you're willing to respect your wife's needs above your own, but don't feel guilty for your own feelings still existing.**

I’ll never marry a girl just because of how she feels, feelings can fade, I’ll marry a girl if we fit, compliment each other, never give up on each other etc etc. we see it time and time again, think back to 5-10 years ago. Are you the same person? Do you like the same things? Some yeah, some probably not. 


Don’t get me wrong, it can’t be 100% one way or another, still gotta be some spark and attraction but relationships change as you move along with time. 



Once feelings fade, if you don’t fit, you’re left with only reasons to leave. If they fade and you fit, you both will work on it to build it back up.

2025-08-14 17:40:26+00:00,"Let’s not overreact here. While this guy was an unwitting accomplice, he **was** an accomplice to murder. Because of his actions, a life was permanently ended. Their friends and family lost them forever, there will never be true justice for the person who was murdered. Yah, if we take OP’s friend’s words at face value (assuming he’s not lying, there’s a reason those laws are written the way they are), then he didn’t know the guy was gonna rob the place… but that doesn’t change the fact that he still drove the guy there, waited for him, *heard him shoot the clerk*, still waited for him, drove him away, and then likely kept his mouth shut about the whole thing. And people usually don’t just rob and murder people out of nowhere, there’s a good chance this guy knew his neighbor was sketchy, but he still got involved with him. The evidence was clearly stacked enough for a jury to convict him. 

I have sympathy for the guy but let’s not act like this is some grave injustice and he was a Boy Scout on his way to Bible study when the cruel police threw him in jail for no reason. He took part in murder, and even though he may not have known the guy was gonna commit crime, he also did nothing to distance himself from him. Even in the most sympathetic light, this is a good reminder to be careful about who you associate with."

I used to come in at 9 and leave at 6. I would constantly be harassed by managers for coming in 30 min late, and every time I'd have to remind them I work until 6. They of course come in around 8:30 and most of them always left early around 4:00 pm (of course no one gave them shit) so they never saw me stay until 6 they just assumed I left when they did.

So much of the struggles we deal with in the corporate world are due to trust issues between employees and management. Sure, sometimes they are warranted, but in my 20+ years of working the biggest offenders of ""stealing time"" or operating outside of company policy have always been the manager or executive level people."

First, a friend's mother had been raped repeatedly from ages 9-14 by her stepfather and her mother was aware of it and did nothing (this happened from 1954-1959) . It finally stopped because the she apparently ""aged out"" for him and he began moving on the 8 year old younger sister. Confronting the stepfather & mother and threatening to call both the police and her grandfather resulted in stepfather leaving and filing divorce.  Mother & daughter never reconciled, maintaining an icy distance for over fifty years, and the younger sister never knew how close she came to being his next victim.

Second. A friend asked me to clean up their son's home computer. I was prepared for the the browser porn history, limewire downloads, etc. What I wasn't expecting was the messaging from the female school classmates (grades 8-10). His mother had complained about how ""aggressive"" girls are these days, calling boys, showing up, etc. What she didn't know was the level it went to - they were sending explicit nudes/encounter photos along with recounting their hookups. It appeared to be a competitive thing about who was going to be his ""girlfriend"" .  I nuked everything (hard delete with all drive deleted & empty space overwritten with 0x00) and gave his mother a list of their names so she could deal with him and call the girls' parents."

2025-08-14 17:42:34+00:00,"Entering the life as a politician, its chaotic and painful yet i learned and forever grateful that I had the chance to help people"
2025-08-14 17:42:34+00:00,"My dad taught at different local universities on the side his whole career.  One of the professors (Fred) he was super friendly with was a decade younger. 

My dad served as a Marine in WW2 as a teen towards the end.  my dad was also German American.  He was born and raised in NYC, but spoke German with his family. 

Fred would always hug my dad goodbye. They mostly spoke in German. 

Fred was Jewish. In Germany. His mother and he were hiding separate from the rest of the family. Mostly so his older brothers had a chance of surviving without needing to worry about Fred (6) and the mom.  The sister was able to flee the country. Plus hiding 6 people was hard. His dad had already been taken. 

The Nazis were coming and it was known that anyone hiding would be found.So Fred and his mom were buried in a box. So were other people. They were told they could last 3 days. No idea how. I wish I knew. They thought they could get to them sooner. The Nazis didn’t leave as quickly as expected. They had shovels hidden and neighbors close to start digging when given the signal. 

My dad and other German American Marines were in the area. All who spoke German and blending in. They showed up when digging had started. The neighbors thought they were Nazis and would be shot. Instead they helped to dig. There is so much more that happened after this. But this is already long. 

My dad dug Fred and his mom out. 

The being buried alive part is what shocked me to the core. 

Fred and his mom were pretty much buried in their own grave. Relying on others to not only survive, but to be able to dig them out in time.  I can’t even imagine Fred’s mom making that decision. Fred, his mom, the sister, and only one brother survived the war. 

My dad and Fred had stayed in contact since then. When we would visit Germany, Fred’s family would treat us like royalty. If they came to the US, they always would visit and stay with us. 

After I found out how they met, it all made sense.  I thought my dad was just really good friends with a colleague. 

There are other stories I will never know. I just know as a little kid, people would come up crying and hugging my dad when we were in different parts of Germany. We would go to homes. I would play with the kids and my dad would be with the adults."

2025-08-14 17:42:36+00:00,"First know that there are good reasons for you to be this way. Maybe in the world where you grew up, there was no reward for being *someone* and it was better to just hide, or there was no more reward for standing up for yourself. Understand that in the end, all morals are knowledge and if you change your idea of what is right and wrong, this changes what you do.
Case in point: I used to think that it is morally wrong to make other people feel bad. Just grew up that way. The issue: it isn't.
In order not to people let walk over you, learn to value yourself and that it is simply part of ensuring your own survival that you don't have to think of others first before you act (at least not habitually)."

Of the 22 associates at the firm when I left (not including the four who were promoted), only one had been there longer than me.

One day she came in looking pale (she was hungover) and later in the class she actually fainted. I ran to her, caught her on her way down and made sure she didn't bang her head on the floor. I got everyone at to go get some water and call someone to come help. She wasn't out for long, when she came to I just helped her up and out to the hallway to rest on a bench and called her a cab home.

Later in the everyone was teasing me how I just transformed into a completely different person. I felt super embarrassed by it because I didn't realize I went overboard. 

We never dated, she wasn't interested, & I eventually got over her. But she did thank me for helping her that day.

When the competition is Shakespeare it's difficult to declare any other book better, so I won't even try. Besides, this is not only a favorite for Shakespeare's plays but also because it's the most beautiful book I own now and it craps all over my old facsimile edition, which was done with lithography and in a reduced facsimile that made the letters tiny. This is a 100% authentic reproduction of the Phelps-Clifford Folio in the British Library. It's a photographic facsimile that is precisely color-corrected, it's the exact same size as the original, and even the binding is stamped with the same gilt lettering as the original. The only difference is that they clothbound it in red instead of binding it in red leather, but that's okay because a leather binding would have vastly increased the prize and killed a cow to no purpose. It's as close as I will ever get to holding a real First Folio in my hands."

Whether or not you have a strong relationship, the sexual contact is objectively part of what keeps your husband (assuming you have a husband and not a wife) connected in the relationship. What degree that plays, obviously I have no idea. But I think you're minimizing it all the same. If you think you could tell him ""I don't want to have sex for a year"" and that wouldn't materially change your relationship at all, I'm sorry, I think you're completely incorrect. But it doesn't matter because you don't need or want to do that from the sound of it, so count yourself as fortunate to have a great relationship 👍🏻"

Spotify's algorithm is tepid, most of the time, in a way that really bothers me. If I listen to more than an hour's worth of music, it just kind of devolves into the same songs it always replays, and doesnt have the courage to show me anything new.

I appreciate Apple avoiding algorithmic sorting in favour of curated playlists in the abstract, but in practice none of them ever quite hit my sweet spot either.

Youtube music lost too much of what made Google music good, and infused Youtube awfulness in it's place. It might have gotten better in the years since I subscribed, but when I left, it was good riddance.

I use Spotify free eight now, but if I was going to be coaxed into paying for any of the three, it would be Apple Music, I think."

Within the last 3 months we found out her son was a serial child  predator. He was picked up by the FBI for soliciting a minor over fortnight. The most recent tally was 40 additional victims, and a production of Child Abuse material charge.

And there is so much more. He was only 13 years old when he began assaulting younger children in his karate class. 


We had no idea. The family friend hid everything. Not only that, but refused to acknowledge it was a problem and still kept him in activities that would have him around unattended children. After he was thrown out of karate class, his parents thought it would be a good idea for him to be a camp counselor. Where he was also fired for being inappropriate with a child. It's been the most insane rabbit hole piecing this together. 

My husband ran into his father this morning at the gas station and Said he couldn't even look at him or else he was afraid he would kill him.

 I assisted an older doctor with his application over the phone for multiple hours to send a single document. Literally just a letter we needed showing his new employment. He could email it, upload it, send a picture of it. Mail it. He tried cussing me once and I had to set him straight. I ended up walking him through scanning it step by step over the phone. Took like 4 hours. We eventually got his application completed. After he moved in he got fired within a week (go figure, he couldn't send or a single letter) and never bothered to pay a day of rent. A doctor! He drove a super fancy car but didn't pay his rent. He also complained the entire process despite me going above and beyond to help him.

There is actual evidence supporting that sex before marriage drastically reduces the chance of staying married. Homophobic, yes. But not towards the people, but rather the sin itself. It is a perversion of the beautiful intimacy exclusive for marriage, but outside of it. It goes against one's own nature -- the way God intended us to be. Controlling, no? We have free will, duh. We choose ourselves whether to follow Jesus or not. Suppressive of critical thinking, no? To reach the state of faith, one must contemplate deeper than most, holistically. The bible is very logical. Violent, really? Since when did Jesus endorse violence? What happened to turning the other cheek? Loving our enemies? Just because ""christians"" in the past affirmed themselves through violence, does it have anything to do with actual scripture. And, God, causing the flood for instance, was completely righteous. We are his creation, and those he got rid of were beyond saving, and truly wicked. The consequence of sin is death. We should be happy that God even lets us wake up in the morning, and taste life, for we all are guilty of sin."

If just to meet women in general then the list is long: Work, school/classes, locations where sports or hobbies are pursued, church, travelling and volunteering are just some common ways.

I met my wife where we both worked. Many meet in college or by taking classes. 

Church is a good place to meet if you are so inclined and are leaning towards a relationship. 

Common sports and hobbies are always a good place (we know a couple who met at a Lego event and ended up getting married). 

Volunteering, like at an animal shelter is likely going to help you meet kind and caring women. 

Another couple we know met during a layover in an airport while they were on separate trips and kept in touch before dating. 

I don't think there is one good place, but many. For example, I've smiled and said hello to many ladies in the grocery store which may have led to an intro if I was not married."

For context, I work at a nursing home/rehab center, and my direct boss is the administrator of the entire building.

A few years ago, we had a resident who was making great progress in her rehab, to the point the rehab department and our social worker had started the discharge planning. 

They come up with a date for the following week and the son and resident (resident was slightly confused, so the son made the decisions) both agreed. That said, up to this point, the son has been a major pain in the ass about basically everything. Everyone hated dealing with him. 

One day, as my boss comes in, she’s being wheeled out on a stretcher. Confused (since she’s normally contacted in off hours if a resident is going out unexpectedly), asks what’s going on. The son tells her that he felt she wasn’t doing well and called 911. She asked if the facility doctor had agreed to this, and the nursing supervisor says the doc didn’t find it medically necessary. 

Son kept insisting and said “well I’m a doctor.”

Boss asks him “oh so you’re a medical doctor who’s qualified to make decisions?”

He responds with “uhhh no…I’m a doctor of education.”

Boss basically proceeds to tell him that just like her, he’s not qualified to make medical decisions like that, but if he really wanted her to go, he’d have to sign paperwork saying he’s taking her out Against Medical Advice. 

He begrudgingly signs said paperwork and off they go. 

Hospital tried to send her back but we were allowed to refuse on the ADA grounds and never heard from them again. "

People likely started asking this question as a way to actually get the other person's view on the situation and reasoning behind their action. But since you keep asking/hearing that question in situations where A, the one who is asking, is frustrated by B, and B's actions actually were unjustified and B doesn't have an answer, you start associating that question with the situations ""you did something stupid and I am irritated"" and started using them in such.

People generally don't analyze _all_ the things they are saying down to lexical or morphological level. We have fixed constructions that we are used to using in certain situations, so we do so without thinking much about it. It's like how we started using ""incredible"" for something that is very much believable, just very good, or how teachers are asking ""where is X?"" while meaning ""why has X not come?"". In most cases we are not talking to pals with autism or other things that can interfere with reading into these sayings, so our interlocutor gets what we _mean_ despite what we are _saying_ — and responds accordingly (like saying ""X is sick"" instead of ""X is at their house""), which further reinforces the construction"

I never thought I’d have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect — and I believed him.

But I found out that months ago and it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex — the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere. She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a video, then blocked her again. I don’t understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he’d been sending flirty videos of other women — ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)— and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these “babes” , and he reacted same like “yeah babes “way I find disrespectful.

He says it means nothing, but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can’t ignore the feeling that he’s emotionally immature — and that I can’t fully trust him.
Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can’t continue anymore after this.

The acting is so terrible and it was difficult to get through one episode. I think there’s a lot of blind loyalty to the franchise. I know a lot of dumb/racist people complain about the casting though and that’s not really my concern. I’m not really a one piece fan, though I do like the art. I feel like a lot of the appeal gets lost without the cartooning/drawing style.

One, look around. Most of the violence in the world is done by men.

Two, why do you think they are often considered protectors? Do you think it's something their genes? In their ""heart""? Or is because they are typically bigger and stronger than all other types of humans?

I think it's very natural for humans to protect what they value in any way they can. But men have had the physical advantage. Plus, I think that has also been transferred to societal standards. Which leads back to you thinking men are born to protect."

Never thought he would do something like that, he was seemingly very nice and respectful had the same girlfriend since the 8th grade. He was too scared to ever smoke or drink with any of us yet he did that. He was the local car guy among teens and was always helping everyone with car related issues for free. I had seen this guy as one of the most trustworthy people I know, this was a really eye opening experience for me to realize that you never really know people and it's made me an even more protective parent."

-Outsource some of the mental load: find reliable study buddies/accountancy partners. If you're lucky, you may find people who you need your help the way you need theirs. 

-Break down your assignments as much as you can, and when you work at it, don't ""work on the assignment"", only ""tackle this one item"". Cross it off when you're done, make a meal out of it, cross it the fuck off.

-If you have a diagnosis, check if your school offers accommodations/support. There's also adjunctive treatment you can add to your stimulants, which can help with how they taper off in efficacy in the evening (at least they do for me). Worth looking into if you feel a big difference there.

-Find your Köln Concert: I listen to the Keith Jarrett's Koln concert when I have word based tasks to accomplish. Music brings [a wealth of benefits](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10765015/#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20a%20pleasant,of%20serotonin%20upon%20unpleasant%20music.), among which boosting serotonin and dopamine release, which helps us tremendously. For me it's important that the music be entirely instrumental because lyrics get in the way, I can't not listen to them and I become unable to complete writing tasks.

Give yourself grace and compassion. Recognize how hard you are working and how far you've come while continuously carrying extra weight. Remind yourself that at the end of the day, only you matter. This diploma is a thing you want, but if you stop it today, you are 100% of the person you were born to be, and you have the rest of your life to continue exploring and enjoying being that person. I'm not saying that to suggest you should stop your studies, but put them in their place. They are a thing you are doing for you. The end goal is you."

An old guy comes in and starts grilling me with questions. What's this deal? Why do I need to answer this question? How long will everything take? Etc etc. I'm answering the same questions over and over and he's making it clear he doesn't believe a word I'm saying, so I offer to bring him to an optician and he can ask them his questions. I grab the new guy and let him know the situation (that is, the patient wasn't listening to what I had to say and I was pretty sure it was because I was a woman, which happened a lot, and I need him to confirm what I was saying). He agrees, walks out and asks the patient what's up. The patient starts to explain his questions again and the optician cut him off told him that I'd been working at that store for years and knew way more than him about what he wanted to know, and walked away.


It was pretty satisfying."

2025-08-14 17:53:50+00:00,"One of my closest friends was a pedo. He was molesting his teenaged step-daughter and adopted daughter while they slept at night. He killed himself while on a business trip when confronted about it. 

Initially, his father told us that he killed himself due to ""mental health issues."" His wife didn't immediately return texts or phone calls for some time after, which we now understand, so many of us were reeling in how our happy-go-lucky friend got so depressed that he killed himself.  I went weeks feeling a gut punch about it and how I missed the signs of him being depressed. 

Then my wife went over where his wife told her all about it. I went from hurt and confused to pissed and really just wanting to forget about the guy. 

I still don't understand any of it. The guy never, almost oddly so, never discussed sex in any way. Didn't really even joke about sex, ever. He was that one friend that just really never brought it up or really engaged in ""guy talk."" We actually thought that he was closeted gay, if anything, which he knew would be fine with all of us, of course. When I heard that he killed himself, I initially thought that living in the closet was too much for him and this was why. Then to find out he was a pedo was even more confusing. I considered him to be a good person, and I was wrong. When I talked with his wife, I let her know what I was feeling and she said, 'don't feel that way, I was his wife and I had no idea that he was or that he was even possible of doing something like this.' It's been about five months and I'm still lost on it all.

It's not quite a giant-assed fee, but it's there. The upside is that people tend to spend more when they use a card - around 15% more - so it's more than worth it to accept cards. Merchants that offer a credit option also attract more customers overall which increases their bottom line. All this to say that the fees aren't always passed on to the customer (both cash paying and card paying) because they are worth the expense, except in very low income areas/establishments."

So they're not remorseful because they've betrayed me, they're remorseful because they think I'd forgive them? That doesn't sound like someone I'd want to be with anyway.

2025-08-14 17:55:45+00:00,"I’ve been struggling with a response, have typed out and erased several. 

I’m not good with grief myself, though I’ve faced it a reasonable amount. I don’t really have any great wisdom to give. Only to struggle on, and try to find joy in life despite it. 

There is an anecdote about grief told of the Buddha. I’m not a Buddhist, but I think it is interesting - I’m not quite sure what to make of it. 

In the story, a woman had a child, and the child died. The woman was crushed by grief, and asked all the wise people who could bring her child back to life. She was so sad she could no longer live. The wise people told her to ask the Buddha (then alive) for help. 

The Buddha said “bring me a mustard seed from a family that has never known a death. Then I will surely bring your child back to life”. 

The woman went from house to house, asking for a mustard seed. However, in each house, she heard stories of the griefs caused by death. Parents, children, brothers and sisters - every house had someone who had died. 

In the end, after hearing all these stories, she returned to the Buddha without a mustard seed, and told the Buddha “I understand the true meaning of suffering.” The Buddha said: “death is universal. Those who are born cannot avoid dying. Grief will not give you peace of mind. You must let go.” 

I’m not quite sure what to make of this story. When i first heard it I found it maddening - was the Buddha holding out the promise he could bring the child back with magic, only to pull the rug from under her feet? That seemed kind of cruel. 

On the other hand - if the woman truly could not get past her grief and live, maybe some sort of shock treatment was necessary? Her grief was holding her back. Truly it was useless. 

Perhaps in hearing all the stories of other people going through grief, makes one realize one is not alone, and find a way to live again? 

I’m not sure. All I know is that people have been struggling with this since there have been people."

I never thought I’d have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect — and I believed him.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago and it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex — the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on…She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn’t react) I don’t understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he’d been sending flirty videos of other women — ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)— and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these “babes” , and he reacted same like “yeah babes “way I find disrespectful.

He says it means nothing, but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can’t ignore the feeling that he’s emotionally immature — and that I can’t fully trust him.
Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can’t continue anymore after this. 
I know that is not some serious shit but I would never thought I would find that about him and it’s partly destroyed my image of him."

And then when they're done embarrassing themselves or giving themselves enough rope to hang themselves on, throw everything wrong that they just said back in their face and then ask them if they're an idiot or differently abled. 

When you talk step by step how someone treated you and how they acted, it's like taking them by the hand and pointing out each shit they took on the carpet and rubbing their nose in it.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago and it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex — the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on…She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn’t react) I don’t understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he’d been sending flirty videos of other women — ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)— and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these “babes” , and he reacted same like “yeah babes “way I find disrespectful.

He says it means nothing, but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can’t ignore the feeling that he’s emotionally immature — and that I can’t fully trust him. Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can’t continue anymore after this. I know that is not some serious shit but I would never thought I would find that about him and it’s partly destroyed my image of him."

Even when I did eventually leave, I was convinced I had made a huge mistake and would die alone. 

It took a lot of therapy and healing to understand that the lack of sex wasn't the problem, the problem was his complete disregard for my feelings about it. I was willing to work through his low libido issues but he refused to talk about it at all. He completely disregarded my emotions for years and made me out to be the bad guy whenever I raised concerns. 

Life genuinely got so much better when he was out of my life. Once I was out of the haze he kept me in, I saw how poorly I was being treated and realized that a good man wouldn't act that way. I cannot stress enough what a weight it was, begging to be wanted, and how much my life improved when that weight was removed from my shoulders.

The rhetoric was pretty convincing until someone replied that there aren't enough tables in the venue to display how much alcohol a person is permitted to buy- Unlimited.

What's the point of imagining the worst age gap that you'd allow? Why not just judge the person buying too much alcohol rather than having committees hear arguments about a maximum? If there's a particular marriage you object to- An actual one- Let's talk about what should've happened there instead. Was it the state that dropped the ball or the citizens involved?"

2025-08-14 17:59:24+00:00,"I brush my teeth twice a day at a minimum.   I have four that I use.   All of differing firmness.   The most firm isn't used very often - mostly after eating something that gets really stuck in my teeth.   The next one down gets used maybe once a week.   Next down is used most often - usually every morning and other times during the day.   The last one is the softest and I use it in the evenings a few times a week.   

  
The two that get the most use get changed out every 3-4 months.   The other two will go for a year.



Every month or so, I put all four into a glass along with my night guard and hydrogen peroxide for a while to help keep them cleanish."

Trading compulsion for abstinence isn't solving your problem its refusing to acknowledge the true nature of your problem.

An investigation into misconduct and feedback regarding job performance is apples and oranges. In an investigation, one would hope an employer would gather facts to determine if the allegation was true or not before taking action. You can prove if somebody did or didn't do something they weren't supposed to. But job performance is much more nebulous. How do you investigate something like ""He isn't very responsive to emails"" or ""He often has a bad attitude"". You can't, and it's not fair to the person that is said about not to give them a chance to dispute it and show why it isn't true."

He essentially got a slap on the wrist, though he did need to register as a sex offender. That was definitely shocking. He was involved in so many community youth events and when I tell you there was nothing, there really was nothing that would have given even the slightest hint. He seemed genuinely humble, friendly, and caring. His family was well connected but he was never flashy about it and never seemed to use that, at least that we knew. There have been similar stories over the years of others but usually I would think “yeah, that checks out”. This was the most shocking because it was truly a blindsided moment."

I never thought I’d have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect — and I believed him.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago when the topic of “how some men don’t want to show their phones to their partners” came up, he had no problem showing me his messages and found something it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex — the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on…She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn’t react) I don’t understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he’d been sending flirty videos of other women — ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)— and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these “babes” , and he reacted same like “yeah babes “way I find disrespectful.

Of course, I confronted him about it, but I don’t know what he was trying to prove to himself. He has me, he says I’m perfect for him, that I give him everything he needs and wants — yet I don’t understand why he felt the need to send those kinds of messages.

He says it means nothing, and he loves me and I am only one for him but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can’t ignore the feeling that he’s emotionally immature — and that I can’t fully trust him.
Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can’t continue anymore after this. 
I know that is not some serious shit but I would never thought I would find that about him and it’s partly destroyed my image of him."

2025-08-14 18:02:46+00:00,"For the person who thought this was the first ""AI Slop"" they've spotted in the wild... keep looking.

I asked Chat GPT if this resembled AI slop, here is the response:

""No — that story doesn’t read like “AI slop” at all.

“AI slop” usually refers to text that’s generic, repetitive, vague, and lacking in concrete sensory detail, specific dates, or distinctive narrative voice. Your story has the opposite qualities:

* **Specificity** – Mid-1990s timeframe, Gurnee paintball, Joliet, Minneapolis, FBI card, SUVs, sandwiches at lunch, SEAL Team 6 lie, hepatitis, etc.
* **Personal perspective** – It’s told in first person with your own reactions, emotions, and moral stance toward the friend.
* **Narrative arc** – There’s a beginning (FBI contact), buildup (phone call, arranging paintball), climax (arrest), and resolution (prison, later life/death).
* **Idiosyncratic detail** – The paintball setup, the fiancée’s military honors request, the pregnancy twist — these are highly individual elements that wouldn’t typically emerge from generic AI output.
* **Voice** – It’s conversational and authentic, with natural digressions and humor/sarcasm (“shithead,” “I’m good, we should hang out, I miss you, man.”). AI-generated filler often avoids that kind of personal tone or does it awkwardly.

If anything, it reads like a vivid personal anecdote you’d hear over beers, not machine-generated filler.

If you want, I can point out a few small spots where editing could make it even sharper without losing that authenticity — but it’s already far from “slop.” """

Never heard her say a negative word about anyone else, and she truly believed everyone was good at heart in spite of everything she went through.  Her having the felony on her record really impacted the rest of her life in less obvious ways, like for example in her dating life.  I witnessed several long term boyfriends hold that against her and convince her she didn’t deserve to be treated properly because of it.  “No one else will love you” type of shit.  I think she eventually found some form of happiness with her latest ex husband, but i always wonder how different her life would have been if that 20 something year old creep didn’t get ahold of her as a minor child (and right after both of her parents died at 15) during her most vulnerable time.

She became disinterested in growing deeper in relationship with me, and was doing the minimum to keep stringing me along because I was paying the bills for her and her kids. And because I genuinely loved her, I was always hoping things would eventually get better between us.

That sucks man.  I dated a girl for about a year who lived that situation.  She was born into chaos, a father who was a raging alcoholic who drank himself to death when she was like 8 years old.  From that point till she moved out at 17, her mother remarried 5 more times.  Between some of those marriages, they lived in a car, her and her mom.  Some women will do literally anything to try to get a roof for their kid."

2025-08-14 18:03:32+00:00,"I never thought I’d have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect — and I believed him.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago when the topic of “how some men don’t want to show their phones to their partners” came up, he had no problem showing me his messages and found something it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex — the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on…She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn’t react) I don’t understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he’d been sending flirty videos of other women — ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)— and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these “babes” , and he reacted same like “yeah babes “way I find disrespectful.

Of course, I confronted him about it, but I don’t know what he was trying to prove to himself. He has me, he says I’m perfect for him, that I give him everything he needs and wants — yet I don’t understand why he felt the need to send those kinds of messages.

He says it means nothing, and he loves me and I am only one for him but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can’t ignore the feeling that he’s emotionally immature — and that I can’t fully trust him. Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can’t continue anymore after this. I know that is not some serious shit but I would never thought I would find that about him and it’s partly destroyed my image of him."

I've had death anxiety that developed to severe OCD and PTSD by the time I was 10. I created the pattern of imagining the worst scenarios possible to be ""prepared"" for them then added therapy which dug into those fears to ""get over them"" which really just made it worse and more insecure than I ever was.

I forgot to mention that they both had some nice and memorable moments involving Egyptian men as well. They both had a couple of instances that they described as endearing where guys sang to them on the street. Natalia was morena (dark-skinned like mulatto), and I guess one time she found out that the song they had sung was a classic Egyptian song that celebrated dark-skinned women. 

Claudine had an instance where an Egyptian guy that was a friend of a friend and crushing on her big time took her to a very romantic restaurant overlooking the Nile for a date.  It didn't progress into anything serious because he was too religious for her. She described him has as very sweet, respectful, and a caballero (gentleman). She would also later come to find out that the restaurant he had taken her to was the equivalent of a typical month's salary there. 

One thing worth noting, the Egyptian Pound has lost A TON of value against the USD, Euro, end pretty much any other major currency in recent years. My first time there $1 was equivalent to around 8 or so Egyptian pounds. This was maybe 20 years ago give or take? When I was there a few months ago, it was around 50 Egyptian pounds. To put that in perspective, there's a well known chain all around Egypt called GAD. I happen to love shawerma, falafel and other sandwiches like that, so it's my to go to wherever and whenever I'm in Egypt. As of a few months ago, a falafel sandwich was about 12 pounds. A good-sized shawerma sandwich that I often had trouble finishing in one sitting was 98 pounds.  We went to a VERY nice hotel restaurant on one occasion for dinner to celebrate someone who was returning to their home country.  The grounds of this classic hotel were straight out of a magazine and the tables/chairs had an unbelievable view of the Pyramids. Even with that, I think my portion of the bill was around maybe 900 pounds. It's funny to think that for about the same as going to an Applebee's or TGIFriday's, it was an amazing meal with a spectacular sunset view of the Pyramids.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that Egypt suffers from some EXTREME poverty and it's one of the most heart-breaking things I see when I go there. But for people like you and me who are fortunate to live and work in developed nations, the cost of living is absurdly low."

Problem is every getaway driver says that.  In general though, felony murder I believe it's called, is a great law.  Two teens try to rob a gas station, both with guns, clerk pulls a glock and starts shooting.  One teen is dead, one managed to escape on foot.  He's caught and HE is charged with the murder of his friend, not the clerk.  Because he went to that gas station to commit a felony and his friend died in the process, HE gets a murder charge.  I'm 100% for it in that setup."

And I doubt the neighbor just sauntered casually out of the place like nothing was wrong. I believe he may not have been in on it, but I’d have serious doubts about his naïveté.

Joined a gym, changed my diet, got a new sound system in my car, and I'm working really hard on the physical aspect.  I figure I just need to focus on getting me back first.  I do go to a few bars for social activities, trivia, karaoke, etc..  I've taken martial arts classes.  Learning how to shoot a  gun well.  I don't tell him where I'm going and he doesn't ask me.  If he does I'll remind him that I didn't know he was going to prostitutes for sex for years, so he has no right to even think about asking me.
It has been years since he recognized my birthday or anniversary.  I got tired of initiating conversations, so I've stopped.  My spouse and I can go days without speaking - separate bedrooms.  I no longer remind him about getting his car serviced, Drs. appts., (mine & his).  I no longer launder, shop (Christmas & birthdays included), sign cards with his name, or cook for him.

What I DID hear was every time at 7am when I was trying to go to bed the mom screaming at the top of her lungs 'WAKE THE FUCK UP '. Suffice it to say I didn't talk much when she tried complaining to me about the other neighbors having guests over all the time. Sure, they turned out to be drug dealers, but they never woke me up."

She's working an office job, and a telecom tech was up a ladder fixing something. She looks over, notices his nice new butt set, says out loud, ""hey, nice equipment!""... and only then realizes that because of him being up the ladder, she called out his "" equipment"" while eye-level with his crotch."

2025-08-14 18:11:30+00:00,"Semantics.  Greed is the negative aspect, preparedness is the positive.  Every 'cardinal sin' has a corresponding virtue, and the difference between them is 'excess'.

Lust is a sin.  But it is also the safety net for the species.   
Wrath is a sin. But righteous indignation motivates us to fight for what is right.  
Pride is a sin.  But pride can also push us to do better.  
Greed is a sin.  But it allows us to prepare for future need.  
Envy is a sin.  But it can push us to work harder to earn that which we lack.  
Sloth is a sin.  But if you apply it properly, it's efficiency.  Using the least work for the best result.  
Gluttony is a sin.  But again, it's a survival mechanism.

All of these things can be positive, if we control them... or negative, if we let them control us."

However, it is the *only* treatment for this condition and it (anecdotally) appears effective. It has saved the lives of countless cats. The only way to obtain GS-441524 was through unregulated, black market sources, which posed risks due to unknown quality and safety. There are secret communities of people who obtain it and sell it to those on the black market. My friend found some via Facebook, and also through her friends ""dealer"" (for her cat that almost died of FIP).

2025-08-14 18:13:14+00:00,"I was close friends with someone who was arrested somewhat recently for trying to meet up with a middle-school aged child. We grew up together and at one point were roommates, but had fallen out of touch for a few years when they were arrested.

I was genuinely horrified to see their face on the news. They did not look like the person I thought I knew. But I’m not sure I actually did know them.

I was not incredibly open with them about my own experience of being sexually exploited as a child. They were aware of my trafficking history, though I couldn’t talk about it for many years. I still did not hesitate to break our lease when they plowed through one of my boundaries and performed a sexually explicit act in front of me without my consent. 

We didn’t reconnect after that and I later saw their face on the news. Conviction for possession of child pornography and attempting to meet with a minor.

They never expressly stated they had experienced child sexual abuse themselves, but I suspected they had even before I saw the news. I still suspect that they are repeating a pattern that I often see play itself out in the lives of the people I work with in social services.

My clients are children in CPS custody who have also been exploited and victimized by their caretakers and other adults in their lives. I’m in my fourth year of work in the field, doing really well with it—I connect easily with kids with complex trauma and problematic behaviors, as I can understand their needs from a place of both personal and professional experience. 

I don’t know what happened to my former friend. I’ll never know. I know that something happened early in their life that broke something within them. And I also know that we chose completely different life paths. I broke too, over and over again for years, but maybe I didn’t break the same way. 

I will always wonder why I am mostly okay now and they are a convicted criminal. I think it’s an oversimplification to say that I just decided to be a better person and they decided to become a monster. I do know this: I have been actively working through my trauma in therapy for eleven years—I go every week, sometimes twice, for ninety minutes. I don’t stop trying to make sense of things, and I genuinely want to help other people who have been through what I have been through.

But I don’t know why becoming a cycle breaker became my path. I could’ve perpetuated it all and continued the cycle. For some reason I didn’t. And I’m grateful for whatever factors besides my own choice to heal were put into the equation without my knowledge. I wonder what factors were placed in my former friend’s equation that none of us were privy to."

There was a dude in there, completely nude, washing himself in the toilet. They escorted him out of the bathroom while he was partially still undressed. I thought it was pretty wild for the library.

I currently work with sex offenders and other folks on probation, so I’ve got a whole catalog of tales. I’ve had clients actively masturbating while meeting with me, a client who showed me their genitals so I could see their ringworm problem, clients who have come to the door fully nude when they know it is me at the door, then were surprised when they got arrested for it - this has happened multiple times. One guy my colleague worked with made a suction device to use in his car while he worked as a food delivery person. Enjoy your door dash! I had a guy who smoked crack in the office of his therapist while she was talking to him, which I thought was pretty bold. I once had a client in late stage liver failure and they turned green.

2025-08-14 18:14:57+00:00,"I’m not interested in randomly insulting your passion, but your information could use some clarification.  There are maybe a dozen commercial tuna species, with prices ranging from over $1M USD per fish for prime Japanese sushi market bluefin tuna,  on down to $3-$12/kg for other species/markets ( 
E.g., see Tridge) .  U.S. commercial bluefin fishery uses handlines and harpoons, focusing on top quality of the individual fish.  Bycatch is nearly non-existent in those fisheries:  you literally see exactly what you are targeting when you are harpooning. A portion of the quota is allocated to pelagic longline fisheries as bycatch in a designated area, and is relatively closely monitored. To say that trawling for tuna is “popular” seems like a stretch to me -  ICCAT catches of eastern bluefin totaled 37417 t in 2023.  Of that, only 410 t of that was by trawls.  These are likely midwater trawls, given that tuna are fast-swimming pelagic species."

He enacted terrible COVID policies and then gave him and he friends all the exemptions they needed to maintain their lifestyles, he's presided over the most disastrous implementation of the failed high speed rail line, and he is currenlty pressuring CA democrats and the state legislature to abolish an independent redistricting commission that *voters decided we needed* over 20 years ago just to ""fight Trump"".

2025-08-14 18:15:16+00:00,"Let her know that she can come to you with anything through your actions, not just your words. I think a lot of the reason I didn't confide in my parents was because they, along with most of my friends, were super into purity culture. I think I had mild religious OCD. My mom also tended to overreact about little things or break my trust about things that I told her in confidence.

They were actually pretty permissive about most things, but they were always emotionally activated when talking about what I was and wasn't allowed to do with boys and my body. It makes me anxious just thinking about how on edge my mom was when she gave me ""the talk"" or how scandalized she acted when I asked her what a tampon was. Then, I broke the ultimate rule about being alone with a boy (because pretty much all teenagers with their hormones are going to break this rule). I knew they would victim blame and ignore my feelings because that's what they did for all the smaller stuff, too.

My mom even asked why I broke up with the first one. I told her that he wanted me to do things that I didn't want to do (not telling her the whole story), and she said, ""Well, I'm glad you didn't do anything."" It made my heart sink, and that's when I knew for sure that I could never tell her."
2025-08-14 18:15:17+00:00,"One exfriend/coworker confessed to me that he was a pedo,

We were super drunk at his place one time after partying and we started talking about sex, then about fetishes, he asked me if I had a fetish and a said lingerie/feet, I think it's really common and when I asked him he said he liked kids.

I'm not sure if the thought that I was going to sympathize with him but I just told him, I'm so sorry, you need to get professional help.

The worst part is that he had a girlfriend at that time that knew about it, they even had a plan to have kids and have sex with them and teach them from a very young age that it was a normal way to express their love.

I couldn't sleep for weeks and I thought about what I could do, I threatened him to let our hr department know anonymously and he resigned so I didn't see him again. Then I tried to find his mom/dad to let them know that their son was a pedo, I did, on fb, but because they didn't accepted me as a friend I had to send a direct message to their inbox which to this day has not been seen, probably because it's on their message requests.

Then I found that he had a brother living in Canada and I reached out to him via ig to let him know, he was in complete denial, but because he had two young kids I thought that we would actually listen that his brother is a pedo."
2025-08-14 18:15:17+00:00,"So, all my deep stuff I did without thinking about any of that, but, now, in a much better place, happily not an alcoholic anymore, i have and say universe, love, high vibration type stuff, just as, sincere appreciation for the moment and the universe. Anyway, that’s my way of saying i get where skeptic are coming from, that’s what makes what happened even cooler. 

About a week ago, im getting TikTok videos about the Lions gate portal opening, and to manifest great things and such, in my mind i just think of an6 day as a chance to just appreciate but I don’t think, magically, the stars, any of that, but I still get the occasional TikTok about it like that day. And so the girl is telling the viewers to repeat her big manifesting lines. Stuff about, being open to the universe and its magic, and abundance. And there’s a line in there, show me a sign, so obvious, that it will be undeniable. She says, I will see a dinosaur, that’s how I’ll know the sign. 

So there I am, heading to the store, grab lunch, in my open appreciative mind, I was ready to accept, the dinosaur themed stuff at the store as my sign, that things are okay and nice if you appreciate them so of course I’d see a dinosaur at the store and it’ll anchor these peaceful intentions. And of course any skeptic would say it’s coincidence and self fullfilling, cus it would be. 

The real sign would be undeniable, well, I was walking to the store, taking an unusual route to it, there’s litter all over the secluded little path, rarely taken by anyone. There it was, a tiny plastic toy dinosaur, on the floor, middle of the path..  okay universe, I believe in you now. 😊."

It only ever really worked in ancient Athens (and even then only a small percentage of the population were eligible participants). Representative democracy is synonymous with republic. US is the only democracy that doesn’t elect its president with a popular vote. Other federal countries still use the popular vote.

And yes, the limited size of the House is a problem because the population 100 years ago wasn’t even close to what it is today, which means neither the House nor the EC truly represents the demographics of the US. But of course states with smaller populations wouldn’t want states like California, New York, and Texas to have even more representation, even though the House is supposed to be based on population. It’s also one of the reasons why the weight of your vote can vary drastically based on your geographic location, which sounds ridiculous"

I'm no fool i understand how i failed as a man which makes me unfit for relationship moving forward, i literally have to reincarnate and start over to be in more alignment with what women need/want from a man. so i'm in the desert and not lusting after women in any way to make them feel unsafe, EYES are still.....magnetized to booty sorta speak, i forgive myself for how i lived and move on, trying to be better."

Before, we were living in a single room, so it was super cramped, and we couldn't really match our libido due to wild schedule differences and antidepressants. Porn was escape for both of us, for short moments one of us had a horni moment.

Now we are alone and together, it just doesn't matter, we are free, no one is controlling us, there is no point in it, and it reminded us both of worse times.

After some time we occasionally put on a movie to aid in foreplay/roleplay, but it's rare. At most we sometimes scroll through few couple movies to see what other do in bed, we could try too."

Cut to 10-12 years down the road and I see an article on Facebook with his name on it and a bunch of comments from people who I worked with back then. Turns out he was in court for sexually trafficking his own 9-year-old daughter. His wife was complicit as well, and the comments from people ""close"" to him said they would join as well... I do not know what became of her. They threw the book at him, and he will never see the outside of a prison. Death would be too good for him.

He was caught because someone tipped off his supervisor who ran it up the chain. His wife somehow found out they (the military FBI) were coming for him. He was in a hotel room on a work trip when he got the call and cut his own wrists. They broke his door down and stopped him from bleeding out.

I think about that girl from time to time, even though she was born after I had already moved out of state. I hope she lives the life she deserves, but it still breaks my heart to think about how difficult every day must be for her.

His name was Ryan Gerhardt Jones, from South Dakota, and his case can be found on Google."

Since you haven't done cocaine I'd like to share how those nights go. You start off with some drinks and then the person that can't party without a bag pulls out the bag. I've never done this before is what people say but often times they'll try it. So you do a little line, listen to some music and drink. You tend to drink more than usual because cocaine seems to negate the affects of alcohol. The next thing you know the bag is empty and you hear birds chirping. You realize that you've been up all night doing coke and drinking and now you need to sleep. Well you're not sleeping any time soon because coke. You may eventually fall asleep around lunch time when everything is worn off. Now you need some sleep as your body is in shock from being up all night on coke."

You see a kid fall into a pool, you instinctively try to save them.

But the more I considered it, that's from my perspective of...not one of those people. Of course I'm not keeping score, because I haven't done these terrible things. Maybe people who are capable of these terrible things do have a sense of ""making up for"" the things they're doing?"

2025-08-14 18:20:31+00:00,"If they told me about it themselves, I might give them a second chance (once, at least).  If I found out on my own and they only confessed when confronted, then I'd probably break up immediately.

Them bringing it up themselves earns them a fair amount of credit, imo.  They could have just stayed silent and avoided the entire issue, but they chose to tell me about it instead.  At that point, if they tell me that it only happened once and they won't do it again, I'd probably believe them.  Because again, if they wanted to continue cheating on me, they could have just said nothing.

However, if I find out and confront them, then it's harder to give them a second chance.  It's possible that they truly did only do it once and do truly regret it.  However, it's also possible that they are lying through their teeth and are just trying to weasel out of the consequences.  Both behaviors would look very similar, so I'm a lot less inclined to believe them."

So for her to betray me and go behind my back means it's not about sex. It means something else drove her to this decision that she unilaterally made about our marriage.

The ""needs"" of people in rural and urban areas are not actually different when creating policy on a national level and the interconnectedness of urban and rural economies ensures that if you are creating policy that benefits people at an individual level you will always fundamentally ensure that both are taken care of. This argument that they are fundamentally different and to serve one must come at the detriment of the other has always been intentionally perpetuated to benefit right ideological policy over universally beneficial apolitical policy by ensuring that people who have a tendency towards right wing ideologies are overrepresented. Though it's been so proselytized that some people on both sides sort of take it for granted at this point."

Because we all know that true patriotism can only exist in small towns and only true patriots are heroic bad asses who fight in wars. The people back home who are a hinderance to the mission are the big city folks.  

Seriously, I hate war movies because they ignore the fact that a majority of American live in urban areas and therefore a majority of soldiers also come from those areas.

Even someone that most people might consider ugly would be attractive to some people, again, that destroys you're argument. To say that it is based on facial similarity and is measurable is just ridiculous. 

And I will agree that people can be objectively talented or smart in certain things. Meryl Streep is an objectively talented actor. LeBron James is an objectively talented basketball player. Brian Cox is an objectively smart physicist.

What I'm saying is that not everyone values those things the same when considering a partner. Valuable talent is objective. I may not care that someone is a talented athlete, I don't value that as a good gene for breeding. 

The fact that you continue to misunderstand my point and make ridiculous claims shows that you are the low IQ one. And I'm making that claim based on the facts of this conversation, not just my feelings because I don't understand what you're saying."

Anything you consider to be entirely obvious and unecessary to state 'out loud' and in the ""well of course they will do \_\_\_\_\_"" zone are exactly the ones that need to be stated clearly and discussed openly and calmly.

My youngest and only full blood brother is dead to me. He’s in the TX national guard. Loves holding a gun, loves having power over people. He’s done a lot of border patrol work and loves catching Mexicans and sending them back. 
When I told him how much voting for Trump would hurt other people including me and my family his reaction was “So? What m gonna do what’s best for me and even Trump is better than a democrat.” He became enraged when I told him he was not a good person lol 😂 

He hates women with a passion. The things I’ve heard him say is deplorable. Yet he Talks all the time about how he wants a “spicy” Latina woman or a “sexy black lady” (he’s white AF in case you couldn’t tell) but says the most racist crap about black and Latino men.

He’s totally fine with what Trump is doing and is looking forward to suppressing and controlling people. He feels they deserve it and that the left just looks to cause problems and impede progress. While he’s not “MAGA” per se, he will absolutely not ever turn on Trump and neither will the men he serves with. He would absolutely rather live in a fascist dictatorship than ever see a democrat, socialism or a woman in charge. It makes sense, he is a white Christian male, he stands to gain a lot by following Trump

Regardless, this is NOT the person I grew up with. He’s an active threat to anyone against the current regime and I can honestly say I hope he ends up in the ground soon so he doesn’t hurt any more people or bring any children into the world that he will hurt with his views and personality. Fortunately he seems to repulse most women. I’m so sad at the loss of my younger brother but I won’t be sad to see him go

He’s an atrocious human being."

I can kind of understand the mindset of not like either show, but I really struggle to understand people who think either is drastically better or worse than the other. They’re very similar in quality quality and tone, which is why they’ll probably always be paired next to eachother when people discuss this genre.

2025-08-14 18:24:28+00:00,"I was living with my parents for a bit working the late shift, and my dad kept trying to wake me at 7am to work in the yard Saturday morning. 

Problem was I got home at 3, and I need at least an hour to unwind before sleep.  So I went to sleep at 4.

We fought about that for weeks until I got drunk after work and left threatening messages from the bottom of the staircase all the way to my door. 

The first messages were relatively nice.  ""Do not wake me up before noon I had to work late last night""

The message taped to my door called him every bad name in the book, and told him that I will go buy a wiffle bat and wake him up by beating him with it every time I got home.  I would do this for a month.  If you make me do this there will be no ""learning your lesson."" You WILL be woken up every single day at 3 am violently to ensure that you have trouble going back to sleep. 

The bottom notes were torn down.  But halfway up the staircase he apparently stopped tearing the notes off the wall and went back down.

Never woke me up after a late shift ever again. 

I left the notes up for a few days, then left the last note on my door for a few weeks. 

I'm not proud of it but holy fuck stop being an asshole I didn't work Sunday we could have worked on the yard then.  This was 100% a stupid power play that he lost"

When you bring in experienced managers from the outside and stick them ontop of the existing team members, the existing team feels cheated while the new leadership doesn't fully understand the nuances of the business.

When you promote purely from within and stick new hires underneath them, you get a large pool of inexperienced leaders who are still learning (and struggling) in their role, which becomes challenging for the people under them.  The problem exacerbates when those promoted quickly don't lean those management fundamentals.

When you decide to mix-and-match for the best of both worlds, you get insecurity/envy in the company because those who didn't get promoted look at other teams and see all of the other people they've worked with for years getting promotions."

2025-08-14 18:25:42+00:00,"Yep, my mom was repeatedly abused by her father and her mother didn't do a thing. She's been caring for her mother for decades, she sees her daily, gets her all her groceries, etc.

Many years back, she told me she'd finally confronted her mother and asked her why she didn't do anything. Her mother's response? 

""You should've closed your legs, you little slut.""

She was devastated. She never shared that kinda stuff with me, so I was shocked to hear it. I asked her why she bothered going back over there and helping her so much. No response. I told her that no child is ever at fault for what adults do to them and that what she said was irredeemably reprehensible, so it was best for her to stop doing her all these favors. She just mumbled something like ""I have to though"". No logical response. Just blind, unconditional acceptance at how she was treated. 

The kicker is that my father was also very abusive, as were my brothers, to me. And my mom never did anything about it and even seemed to take delight in it because she's the ""boy mom"" type. I was beaten badly and regularly, my pets were murdered in front of me, every single material item I ever owned was destroyed by 14 years old. But they never molested me. 

So later in life after her mother's gross utterance, I confronted her myself. She admitted to me that she didn't count anything as abuse unless it was molestation and insisted that I was the villain for ""living in the past"" instead of just accepting ongoing abuse forever. Typical narcissist script. 

So I reminded her of when she confronted her own mother. How she couldn't comprehend how her mother could care so little for her. How profoundly it effected her. And I congratulated her for becoming her mother before blocking her and cutting contact for the last time. 

Sad story all around, but life is good now without those ladies in my life."

2025-08-14 18:26:08+00:00,"It’s been a decade since I worked nights and what everyone else has said is true one thing I haven’t seen anyone say is about meetings.  I worked 6pm to 6am if I was relieved on time.  Day shift would usually shut down for a half hour at the end of their shift so maintenance could inspect the conveyers and what not.  So we would get there at 6pm have our meeting and go out to our positions and start up the plant again.  Day shift would leave on time every day.  On night shift we would “hot shift” the plant.  So day shift would get there at 6am have their meeting, catch up with people they just saw 12 hours ago, talk about the news and relieve us at about 6:30-6:45 and be surprised when we were upset that they took forever to relieve us.  Also day/night shift meetings would always be at 6am so that day shift didn’t have to stay past 6pm or didn’t have to wake up early.  If there was an employee appreciation thing, they would do it at 5pm and if we didn’t come in early we didn’t get anything.  If we had to work on Sunday, day shift would get lunch brought in.  Nothing was open for night shift so we were out of luck.  Don’t get me wrong I liked night shift.  It’s quiet, layed back, none of the brass are around and you usually make more money but hire ups really don’t give a shit about you either.  Also this was before DND so fuck the managers who think they can call you at 1pm when you work 96 hours a week.  Just wait a couple hours you’ll see me again."

2025-08-14 18:26:15+00:00,"You’re moving in the right direction, but your answer is still full of incorrect myth about the founding and why the EC exists.

There is no need for the electoral college.  We have literally NEVER USED THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AS INTENDED. The main reason we use the electoral college is because our Founders were making it up as they went along, and didn’t have any live models to look at.  This is quite literally it.

There are two obvious ways to pick a chief executive in a legislative democracy: (1) the people vote, (2) the legislature votes.  **Every democracy in the world**, besides the US, uses one of these methods. So does every state in the US.  

And, of course, these obvious solutions were quickly proposed at the convention.  But both were rejected.  The legislature voting was rejected because they thought it would compromise checks and balances, and lead to back room dealings.  The popular vote was vetoed because the slave states didn’t want their strength diluted by only counting citizens (slaves can’t vote), and because folks were concerned regular citizens wouldn’t be familiar with the candidate pool in the Capitol (which would be the reps from around the country) and would be susceptible to demagoguery.

So the question inquired until the end of the convention, and was tossed to the Committee on Unfinished Parts to make a proposal. They settled on a compromise: we’d use a system like the Vatican’s College of the Cardinals when they pick a pope.  The electors would be picked every cycle and then dissolved, to reduce corruption.  The electors would be wise men familiar with the candidates, insulated from popular passions.  

It was good enough, so they chose it.

And we never implemented it.  The first two terms were unanimous for Washington.  But by the next president, the dream of a learned body coming to reasoned decision was already fallen into party politics.  And voters realized they actually didn’t want their president chosen in a secret back room deal, so states quickly began rescinding the electors discretion and running statewide votes to assign them. 

So now we have a popular election, with the popular votes put through a weighting system to advantage the coalition that hits more narrow majorities in large states. In makes no sense, nobody every asked for it, and it serves no purpose."

2025-08-14 18:26:25+00:00,"Different roles often implies unequal power. Historically, these “roles” place the husband in authority and the wife in submission, that is a power imbalance, even if sugar coated.
Being “equal in value” but unequal in decisionmaking or autonomy is still inequality. 
Equality is not only about worth, but also about rights, choices, and autonomity. So it is sexist.

Purity culture does more harm then good. Its proven that relationship skills are more important in marrige than if someone had premartial sex or not.

""Love the sinner, hate the sin"", still, it comes with harm and exclusion towards the individual. And the apparent fact that homosexuality goes against nature is questionable since same sex relationships or engagements have been observed in hurdreds of animals. Not just humans. Why are humans the only ones where its a problem.

If rejecting christianity comes with threats of eternal torment, is it realy ""free will"". I like to compare it to being held at gunpoint and given a choice which depending on what you chose you either live or get shot. Its not free will in that case. Its coercion. 

The nature of faith is holding something as true without evidance. Which is not logical. And has nothing to do with critical thinking.

I was like ""hey dude, I saw that shit."" and he just grumbled at me to mind my business and when I saw him go closer to the mom I told her what he just did. The sad part was, she actually looked like she got really scared and kinda ducked her head down a bit more.

Idk how that exactly works since it’s a Roth account (after-tax money is contributed). Thats going to the only guy that showed up to help me clean my mom’s house out after what happened to her.   Everyone else that sounded so sincere offering help were crickets when actual help for the smallest things were asked.  The guy that helped didn’t even ask, he just showed up.  I actually didn’t need help, I was working on the house for a few weeks and just wanted someone around for a bit.  Things like my investment accounts have a beneficiary listed as well.  My cars have a Transfer on Death beneficiary and my moms house will be put in my own Trust with a beneficiary. so the only stuff that will be in probate are my physical things in the house.  

The only thing that I can’t put a beneficiary on is a retirement fund that goes for life. The only way to share that is if I was married. If I am not, then it just stops paying out. If I pass away before retirement then they can start collecting part of what I would get when they reach a certain age."

So your a small country.  Not much to give so you might as well give him it all if he invades.  Right...  You know to prevent nuclear war and everything. Because you are suggesting that Ukraine gives up more area than your whole country.  You'd be happy with that.  Maybe someone should just suggest he takes Switzerland instead of bits of Ukraine.

In fact, people drive less in general, and make lifestyle choices around the premise that traveling with a lot of stuff on a daily basis is costly and wasteful.

In the US, you can commute 50 miles a day in a full size pickup truck and doing so will only cost you ten bucks or so in fuel, which turns out to be below a lot of people's threshold of changing behavior over cost.

If the difference in cost between taking a bus and driving your APC to work was more than the cost of a latte, then more people would be talking about fuel efficiency they way boomers talk down to people  about lattes."

2025-08-14 18:29:17+00:00,"I,being in HR, back in late 90’s, had IT come to me.  Network had pinged all this CP that was being viewed and it was coming from one area (computer)…one guy, in Marketing dept. Quietest, nice guy and his computer was pinging these Horrible sites. Told head of IT I would handle and to keep mouth shut.  I went to CEO and Prez (we are a small, upcoming company) told them I was firing him but I was calling cops as well.  CEO said no we don’t want the cops in our office and let that get out on news and all. Bad for business, yada yada.  I said either I call or I leave this place right now (quit), I am reporting this one way or another.  He knew I was serious. Called the cops and fired him all within same hour.  The guy was a Boy Scouts leader and big into that organization.  I came unglued when cops are arresting him, he looks at me and says “you aren’t going to tell my scout leader right?’  My CEO was so red faced when I looked at him and said “oh yeah we’re calling them too.” Prez came in my office and said get head of local scouts on phone.  I called all over Tennessee to find which district he was working with and reported him.  CEO apologized repeatedly for his reaction. President told CEO in front of me , if this ever comes up again I will go to Board and have you removed  if you try to down play it again. CEO was out within three months of this occurring because Board found out how he reacted and due to financial issues that were happening, it was not a good outcome for CEO.  After arrest I had to go to court due to him being arrested from work and all, was horrified what they charged the guy with.  Apparently he had apartment full of CP and had came south (from up North Boston and that area) because he had a background of issues with this kind of behavior!! And was running from warrants on criminal charges prior!! Needless to say we had background checks from then on (it was a financial strain on company, but Board and Prez pushed for it).  Guy served time but I am not sure where he is today (25 years later)."

I don't necessarily think of it as an overall ""keeping score"" necessarily, but an idea of a karmic balance, maybe. Even though one side of the scale has bowling balls and the other side a single feather, it makes sense in their minds.

2025-08-14 18:30:03+00:00,"No.

In 2017, we all collectively agreed that bosses and managers shouldn't take advantage of their employees and that it's nearly impossible to consent when your boss is the person propositioning you and I'm not going to pretend it's okay just because she's a woman. My former boss is a disgusting person. She shouldn't be in a position of power, especially not when she has power over children. If anything, the way she treated me after I complained is an indication that consent was not possible. He could not consent to that relationship. The fact that I was dragged into all of it because she was lying about it was an even bigger red flag. 

I stand by what I did. I had to leave that school. Fine. I went to another in the district and, after that one closed I ended up out of work and I don't feel bad about it. I'm worried money, but I'd rather have integrity and it's much more important to me that my employer understand that she can't be abusive toward me. They were not allowed to abuse me in that way. I do not regret it for a second."

Faked a pregnancy during the whole pregnancy I was there for her appointments , updates, & shopping for his arrival etc she would always call me to update me baby showers ultrasounds etc I was so excited for her! She said they had to induce her bc she was over her due date she went to that appointment & called me after to tell me there was no heart beat I was so heartbroken for her. She went on to have a funeral for her baby & it was the saddest thing to see! My best friend lose her first child. My cousin calls me one day to check fb & BAM 💥 it was like a whole punch to the face. She faked the whole pregnancy lied to everyone for so many months her brothers had her confess about her lies because one had actually named his son after the “baby” & she took money from people from the funeral etc it was wild "

Gentlemen, please schedule a comfortable and sit down conversation with your lady. Be vulnerable, be compassionate. Ask her what she needs. Trust that if she loves you and her needs are met, she will want to feel sexy and intimate again. It's just a matter of getting her used to feeling taken cared of again (when she spends so much time caring for small people who combat her all day.)

The second my husband and I sat down and divvied up household expectations, it became so much easier to know where we both needed to be during the busy times. And when I finally found time where I knew my duties were done and my husband would handle the rest, I could finally focus so much more energy on intimacy. 

It's so hard you guys. It requires so much effort and vulnerability and most of all, compassion. But once you find a rhythm it can flourish again in no time."

2025-08-14 18:33:21+00:00,Wow… That hits hard. I remember the feeling of despair I would feel when we’d get dispatched to a call involving a child. I still struggle with PTSD from time to time. Just the sound of an ambulance responding code 3 is enough to make me lose my appetite and elevate my heart rate. I wouldn’t wish losing a child to even my worst enemy.
2025-08-14 18:33:22+00:00,"I'm not super attractive (I would put myself down as a 6, maybe a 7 on a good day), but I have major Manic Pixie Dream Girl energy. I am a woman, and I can't explain why, but I've just always gotten along with men better than women. Of course, that means that any time I had a guy friend, if he had a gf or even someone who had a crush on him, suddenly I'm the enemy. No matter how many times I would say, ""you think I'm into *him*?"" Or ""we're just friends,"" everyone would roll their eyes and go, ""uh huh, SURE."" I'm literally very very happily married to an insanely handsome and wonderful man, and I'm still getting this shit. (My husband is cool. He moved to our area and had no friends, so when we started dating, he just became a de facto member of my friend group to the point that I'm pretty sure they like him more than me now.)


But yeah. I can't tell you how many parties I wasn't invited to that I later figured out it was because my friend's gf said I specifically couldn't be there because I would try to fuck her man. It hurts a whole lot to be consistently excluded by your friends largely because you are female. This hasn't been much of a problem since I graduated college in 2015, but it was a huge problem for me in HS. Heaven forbid I try to support my dude friends by attending their concerts, sports games, presentations, etc. Obvs, I'm trying to fuck them. "

It's a good arrangement.  Brother looks after some elderly relatives most of the time, and they in turn become the first-line help & alert system when brother gets seizures.

My husband doesn't refer to him by name, but rather as ""brother"" or ""brother of mine"".  It melts my heart when my brother needs help & my husband says it with concern.  When my brother gets too entitled or demanding any other time, my husband's voice reaches a new low register as he glowers and intones *brother of mine*.

After that, my mom scolded me hard — like I had done something really wrong or shameful. Growing up in a conservative family, being naked was treated almost like a sin, so the whole situation made me feel not just physically exposed, but emotionally humiliated too.

2025-08-14 18:34:18+00:00,"I had  experiences with banks when I was young that made me never patronize Wells Fargo or BofA again. Crocker, which Wells took over, had an early version of an IRA. I started it in 1980 with a $500 deposit, but being a part time working student, I never was able to contribute to it. Shoulda read the fine print. No, REALLY shoulda read the fine print. You had virtually no control over investments, and if you didn't deposit the minimum amount of, I think, something like $50/month, they charged fees. EXORBITANT fees. And I only got an annual notice, no monthly reminders. I eventually withdrew it and after taxes and penalties, netted a grand total of $200...5 years later. My own fault, but also a rigged game. Also, I'll confess, a good lesson in money management. I learned to read fine print! 

BofA, on the other hand, was a constant struggle to maintain minimum checking account balances as a poor student working part and full time. The monthly fees would eat away at my low balance, and for what? Access at ATMs when I didn't have money in the account? I eventually left for Washington Mutual because their fees were more reasonable, but the minute a credit union offered universal ATM access, I jumped ship.  It's been at least 25 years with the same CU, and I will never, EVER go back to a commercial bank. No fees, better interest, and no fucking upselling of financial ""products."" BTW, I had to go into a Wells Fargo about 5 years ago to deposit money into my goddaughter's account. Jeez, banks are looking might scuzzy these days-everything was dusty, furniture looked ratty, the clientele were even scuzzier.

2025-08-14 18:34:23+00:00,"I had an older friend that was like a brother for a few years when I was around the time I graduated highschool. We had a business together and lived next door to each other for a few years. This was on a compound (large business, not a cult) in a tourist town where we worked together. There were also young women (ranging from 16-30 years old) who lived there working for the summer. We always got into relationships with them, but mostly just friends. (For context, I married one of them and we've been together for over twenty years now). 

One summer there was a girl who instantly hit it off with this guy, who I had seen date girls way too young for him. She only worked there for a few weeks before going back home for school. He said he felt guilty because he went too far with her one day while making out. Not long after that I moved away and haven't hung out with him since. I ran into that girl at work a few years later and she cornered me almost immediately. She said that friend raped her. She also told me that she was much younger than I remembered her being (my mistake), she was only 16. I remembered what he said and his attitude for a while and think she was telling the truth. I didn't know what to say, and probably didn't handle it well. But my feelings were that he should pay for any crimes, even though I still thought of him as a brother. Weirdly her shift changed and she had to quit the next week. I moved on with my life and never really got any answers. I know that guy helped someone else, a young rape victim, get justice including being a witness in court (completely unrelated). Just weird and I will never really be able to wrap my head around it."

You get taken seriously less often in certain professional and academic settings. You are more likely to be objectified and may not realize the harm in that until it’s already caused a problem. You have to defend things you achieve because there is a bias from colleagues or others that you opened that door or accomplished that task because of your appearance. You can easily mistake someone’s attraction to you for them genuinely caring about you as a person and your wellbeing. People will openly sexually harass you and it gets brushed off because you’re pretty so *of course* someone has to comment on your body, or *of course* someone was going to grab you/touch you/kiss you etc. “it’s all in good fun”. You deal with people assuming you are judging or looking down on them, you deal with people becoming defensive when you’ve done absolutely nothing. I could go on, but there is a lot."

One day he just flat out said it. “I don’t feel wanted and it hurts to not be desired by the person I love”. It was like being struck by lightning and I felt awful. I want to be clear…I understood immediately that this wasn’t a guilt trip for sex. This was 100% an admission of emotional pain.

Always balls to the wall energy, takes charge, takes on more responsibility, is good at directing people and willing to get shit done. Amazing guy to work with, and he’s absolutely being fast tracked to management or at least team lead at a bigger location ASAP

Some of the older guys, who are about twice as old as the new guy and been here for maybe 1-2 years, have started asking me why I’m not the one in line to get promoted, and if we’re supposed to listen to the new guy. They asked if I’m okay with him “bossing me around” when he still needs to ask for help sometimes and I have the answer.

I just laughed, because don’t you think if I’ve been here 4 years, I wouldn’t be on that track too if I wanted it?

2025-08-14 18:36:10+00:00,"I think a lot of people fall into the same mindset, and while I vehemently disagree, I do understand where you're coming from and why some people feel like medication isn't the answer. The fact is that medication isn't the answer for everyone, and even when it is the answer, medication alone isn't a silver bullet to cure everything. 

That being said for the overwhelming majority of people suffering from any form of mental illness will benefit from medication.  While it won't immediately cure you, it will absolutely help mitigate some of the worst of it, allowing you to work through whatever you're dealing with. 

If you got hit by a bus tomorrow and ended up in the hospital with multiple broken bones, would you tell the doctors no actually I don't want pain relief those are drugs? There's absolutely nothing wrong with benefiting from the decades of study from the medical field for either your physical or mental health. 

Nobody sensible will advise you to ignore what doctors are suggesting in any other situation but suddenly when it comes to mental health issues everyone's an expert and wants to tell you what you need to do to feel better. I don't think that comes from a bad place most of the time, but ignorant advice from an uneducated mind is often worse than malicious advice because at least it's easier to spot the latter. 

There are some illnesses like adhd for example, that absolutely require medication for the overwhelming majority of people. You could be the exception, but simply telling yourself you should be better is the least helpful thing you can do and will often make things worse when you're unable to just wish yourself back to full health. 

Change is incredibly hard. It requires tremendous effort and, most importantly, help sometimes that's medication based sometimes talking to someone often its a combination of both. When your own mind is actively working against you, it's usually the absolute last thing that you should be trusting when it comes to how to get better, especially when its suggestions aren't productive."

Global warming - still denied (largely, or at least thought of as something humans can't cause)

Gun restrictions - impossible in any form, regardless of how many mass shootings we have

The Constitution - the stated goal of many of the SCOTUS is this innocuous claim of ""original intent"" - or, reading it in a way that denies any sort of change.

Economics - despite rising inequality and wage stagnation, they still adhere to a version of Reagonomics 

Societal -  They adhere to (largely)  Christian ideals of right  and wrong and want those standards forced on everyone, for example the 10 commandments should be in school but not any other doctrines.  This is just one example

2025-08-14 18:37:46+00:00,"Most of the replies here are around one or both having medical issues preventing sex to occur. That's one thing but I'm sure this post is about if you are healthy and still not having sex. My suggestion if you are looking to have sex and not getting it is to use dread. Go on dates with other women/men, maybe even have sex outside of the marriage if warranted. Life is short, sex is one of the best things on earth and we all have the right to experience it regularly. People can always tell when someone is well-fucked. Your partner will also be able to tell even if they can't pin it down or find concrete proof. 

In my marriage I said from day one that I'm in control of sex, not her. This is because I'm high testosterone and will get upset if I'm not getting it regularly. She agreed and the saying goes ""when do we have sex? whenever one of us wants it"" 

There are times that we don't have sex every day, but or the most part we do almost daily. If it's not happening, use dread and straight up tell her you will be going elsewhere for sex if it doesn't happen. You are not a roommate, you are a romantically engaged couple that deserve one of life's greatest pleasures. She/he isn't giving it, go find elsewhere and you may find that you are much better as a partner for doing this, nothing against the other but they are lacking and you have the right to go find it.

One final point, someone might not be ""in the mood"" but you know what happens the second you engage in intercourse, everyone likes it, everyone (even those who don't ""like"" to do it) becomes happier after the fact, so she/he can suck it up and get the job done. Fuck those who say it's not that important or just put up with no sex for weeks/months/years that's an awful way of looking at it."

Some people are monogamous, some people are poly. Some people are gay, some are straight. Some people dont want anything sexual, some want only sex and no emotional connection.

I am personally not capable of being in love with two people at once. That is a lot of feelings and I am just not wired that way. I prefer monogamy or solitude. Some people though, like my friend are wired the complete opposite. BAM thanks nature for keeping it diverse.

I was slapping her pussy while her whole lower body was tense and she was doing the short-breath thing. Then she slapped my hand away, stuck her legs in the air like a mighty V, arched her back, and began brutally slapping her own clit while panting. Then she let out a bloodcurdling scream and began sort of thrusting her hips while doing this. Then she said ""oh motherfucker, it's not happening"" and went limp and lay there panting.

As long as states' role in elections as intermediaries. if you will, is part of our Constutional structure, we can't just move to direct voting with amendment.

Firstly the Addams work because its a window into the weird from a normal perspective, it works because theyde contrasted against regular society at all times. This isnt that. This is Harry Potter with Wednesday. And it just doesnt land.

Secondly everyone in the family is incompetent except for Wednesday. Pugsley is a weak loser, Fester cant jaywalk without getting arrestedn and Gomez is a bufoon. In what world would Gomez be on the backfoot in a sword duel when 'Tish is on the line, AND be afraid of dying. That should the time of his life.

Spent over $800 on tires, and when I went to my car after I paid I noticed the drivers door wasn't completely closed. I pulled the handle and the door popped open and almost fell off. They had somehow broken the hinge, and rather than do anything about it, they just forced the door closed, which broke it much worse. The worst part was that they didn't say anything to me about it. I went back in and told the owner I needed to show him some damage and he flat out denied that they broke the door, and that it was like that when I brought it in because I drove a shitty car. Looking back I should have taken them to small claims for the damage, but I was young and didn't know better. The best part was I told my dad and him and everybody in his company stopped buying their work truck tires there, which they all replaced 2-3 times a year for about $5k each time.

2025-08-14 18:41:10+00:00,"Asperger’ Children by Edith Sheffer. 

A groundbreaking exploration of the chilling history behind an increasingly common diagnosis.
Hans Asperger, the pioneer of autism and Asperger syndrome in Nazi Vienna, has been celebrated for his compassionate defense of children with disabilities. But in this groundbreaking book, prize-winning historian Edith Sheffer exposes that Asperger was not only involved in the racial policies of Hitler’s Third Reich, he was complicit in the murder of children.
As the Nazi regime slaughtered millions across Europe during WWII, it sorted people according to race, religion, behavior, and physical condition for either treatment or elimination. Nazi psychiatrists targeted children with different kinds of minds―especially those thought to lack social skills―claiming the Reich had no place for them. Asperger and his colleagues endeavored to mold certain “autistic” children into productive citizens, while transferring others they deemed untreatable to Spiegelgrund, one of the Reich’s deadliest child-killing centers.
In the first comprehensive history of the links between autism and Nazism, Sheffer uncovers how a diagnosis common today emerged from the atrocities of the Third Reich. With vivid storytelling and wide-ranging research, Asperger’s Children will move readers to rethink how societies assess, label, and treat those diagnosed with disabilities."

One day, I was googling a different former acquaintance, who had been the head of a club I was in until he got charged with committing a million dollar fraud against his employer (he was head of purchasing IT equipment and set up shell companies that got paid for not delivering anything or delivering cheaper computers), revenge porn, and stalking his ex.

In the another section of the crime section of the news website, I saw my acquaintance who worked in the convenience and stationery store. A couple of decades ago, a serial paedophile had drugged, abducted, raped, and murdered the acquaintance's daughter. Her body has never been found. Over the years, the paedophile had lied about where he buried the daughter. The paedophile was in the news because he was dying and probably never going to reveal the real location of the daughter's body."

2025-08-14 18:43:54+00:00,"Yes.  In no small part to the fact that he's already done this for me.  

We got together when I was 15.  At 18, I developed a drinking problem, was extremely depressed living on my own for the first time and having a crisis of sexuality while being deeply involved in my fundamentalist church.  I cheated on him with one of my friends when we were blackout drunk one night. We were still together and in fact engaged.   We didn't get married till I was 20.  I believe I was 22 or 23 when I finally told him because I couldn't handle the guilt anymore.  It was hard.  I got into therapy. We talked a lot.  And I was lucky that he chose to forgive me both for my actions and for not telling him sooner.  I was more than lucky but I just don't really have the words to describe how fortunate and thankful I am to him.  Don't have the words for the regret and confusion and love I have for him.

Anyway I'm 36 now.  I'm out, no longer part of the church and we're still together and honestly happier and more honest and open now than ever.  We are monogamous.

Now because I understand the feelings of curiosity and confusion and all the complicated feelings about experience and the like, I've told him that if he ever has the desire to pursue someone that I would understand.  Or like if he has a need that I'm not fulfilling because I can't or won't for some reason (we do have a great sex life as it stands) then I would understand him wanting to find a way to have that fulfilled.  So mostly I would be CONFUSED on the need to cheat (doing this without my knowledge of it) when I've made it clear that I wouldn't stand in the way of his needs or curiosity (we've otherwise only ever been with each other and curiosity is natural). 

TLDR: yes, but I'd mostly be confused."

2025-08-14 18:44:15+00:00,"Not married but been together 4 years. We're super young and just moved to a new city. We had an issue w her infidelity about 2.5 years ago that really put a damper on intimacy until about a year ago. I struggle with hypersexuality due to CSA and when I met her she talked about how high her libido was and I shared I was the same. I quickly learned we had two different ideas of ""high"" and after our rough patch it was nice trying to at least work on that part of us. Since then it's been periods of maybe a week or two where we'll be really intimate in more ways than just physically then long stretches of no sex, no general intimacy at all, and feeling like I'm wanting a relationship while I'm in my relationship until she decides she's into it again. Recently those long stretches have resulted in me not wanting to do it at all. Sex is (unfortunately?) the deepest way I connect with a partner I show parts of myself I can't help but to reveal in that vulnerability and I become very dependent on after care and the other parts of pre and post sex that make it enjoyable and intimate and linear but now it feels like having sex would be redundant. It doesn't feel mutual like I'm just scratching a rare itch for her and licking my internal wounds until she decides to look at me again. I've also unfortunately gained weight in the past years and that makes me feel even worse. Sometimes I wish I could just go find someone else but ik it's hard to find someone with even a fraction of the compatibility we have in other areas of our relationship so I stay and hope this will change but deep down I feel like shit for wanting more sex from my partner like some entitled chauvinist."

2025-08-14 18:44:23+00:00,"When I was a baker at a union shop, I had a boss who actually studied our collective agreement to figure out what he could and couldn't do to us via scheduling.  Giving people he was mad at shitty hours was basically his one power move, and he held onto it for years.

But when COVID happened, it gave me room to go over his head to suggest staggered shifts; getting as much stocking & baking work done outside open hours; and midnight starts over what had always been 2:30am or 3:30am starts, so that we were out of the store shortly after customers started arriving.  His go-to move with me after that was to put me on days, stocking the floor, because he knew I was heavily partial to nights; and he was able to argue for ""business needs""-- even though there were also other employees who would rather work those shifts than my midnight baking shifts, and he was making the whole team miserable to get at one person.  

My union gave me the ability to go part-time, and restrict my hours so he could only schedule me at certain times, but hours were doled out to full-timers first, and then the ""anytimers"", and *then* the restricted staff; and I was low enough in seniority within my department that doing this would've left me with about 16 hours a week when things were slow.

But!  One magical day, about 5 years into the job, a couple years into the pandemic, and a slightly different team later, I realized I'd reached top of the seniority list out of our available bakers, and was in a position to restrict my hours while still getting ~32 a week.  I tailored my availability to be exactly the schedule I wanted if I was given a full week's worth of shifts.  I was so excited!

My boss was not.  He'd had me baking 2 nights a week, and then working 3 days, and had been pleased as a pig in mud for ages that he found a way to do that to me that the union couldn't shut down.  He decided that his response to this would be to drag his heels and continue scheduling me 2 nights a week.  I got the union involved, and he doubled down.  I approached him directly for a good-faith discussion on how we could get me up to 20-25 hours a week (what I needed to support myself) in a way that made both of us happy, and he just wordlessly looked at me like I was crazy, while shaking his head.

He was told by his bosses and the union that he had to explain how & why his choices were meeting ""business needs"" better than just scheduling his team according to regular policy.  He tried; he could not.  So his boss took over scheduling for our department.  I decided it looked like a good time to go to management with about 6 years of documentation on his patterns of behaviour.  An investigation was initiated-- and, much to my surprise, my team fully backed me when interviewed; even though one of them was actually a friend of boss outside of work, and most were usually scared of his backlash when it came time to speak up.  It was looking really good for me.

So, naturally, boss up & took ""stress leave"" right as things were concluding, and never came back.  Yes, it was still just as satisfying as if he'd been fired.  Good riddance."

I personally shut down any time someone raises their voice to me. It's clear they don't respect others so I'm not going to respect them.  Want me to listen to you, talk to me like an adult with an indoor voice.

Literally anybodys voice going above a rational tone is unacceptable if the person they're talking to is right in front of them/in the same room. It's 100% disrespectful to the other party. Shows you have 0 emotional control when you get upset and are behaving like a child's tantrum.

Refuses to plan for maternity leave even though entitled to it, or tell ANYONE else at work about the baby.

Meanwhile our manager keeps blowing off appointments that she was the one who scheduled for her side business as a dominatrix. So ends up getting fired. Now it’s only me and pregnant co worker in our department. 

I finally cornered pregnant coworker and told her she either told someone as I wasn’t delivering her baby at work or I was telling HR. She finally told and ended up delivering the next day 😅"

It's the latest political boogeyman, in a previous century it was the Red Communists and before that it was Imperialism. We've seen this dance over and over again.

>Gun restrictions - impossible in any form, regardless of how many mass shootings we have

Address the ill people pulling the trigger, not the means which can be anything.

>The Constitution - the stated goal of many of the SCOTUS is this innocuous claim of ""original intent"" - or, reading it in a way that denies any sort of change.

The job of the courts is to read and interpret the laws as written. It is the job of the legislature and the electorate to change the law, including amending the Constitution which requires clearing some high bars.

>Economics - despite rising inequality and wage stagnation, they still adhere to a version of Reagonomics

Both sides of the aisle are to blame for the failed economic and fiscial policies of the past century.

>Societal - They adhere to (largely) Christian ideals of right and wrong and want those standards forced on everyone

The same can be said of the Left/Progressives, just change out ""Christian ideals"" with whatever suits their fancy. Both sides of the aisle are guilty of this act.

We operate within individual capacity and with influence from the herd and institutions.

I know humans have had a dichotomous nature for a long time. Either-Or thinking contributes to a lot of our perceived issues. 

The categorization and the narrative can be helpful when making sense of things, but maybe at some point, we began living the narrative alone and separated from that life essence.

A lot of learned destructive behavior.

Thinking to the nature of things... organisms seek homeostasis, so the loss of meaning from lacking presence in life while defining the parameters of life, seems to lead to suffering.

Then, we perpetuate the suffering by continuing the narrative and not fully showing up. Basing our lives mostly on things other people imagined up centuries ago, even when it's clearly not working out for the majority.

So, the human condition is stupidity. Imo."

I was like ""what the fuck, this guy just throws a party and gives away over a thousand of booze to the cleaner?"" But hey, he's a bro.

Although to me it then further highlights a situation with the example of OP's story. Which is sort of related, but not exactly the same. 

In your example you're listing two premeditated acts to balance/offset each other. Gym, junk food. Conscious decisions thought about with some sort of planning or intention.

OP's example has an instinctive, reactionary, little to no thought act; a truly gut reaction to a potentially catastrophic situation in which a life was saved, an action that basically everyone would consider ""good.""

On the other side of the scale is these heinous, awful, brutally harmful acts that are done with intention, premeditation, intent. Acts that basically everyone would consider bad or ""evil.""

I'm rambling a bit here, but I'm intrigued by the idea of an ""evil"" person still making instinctual ""good"" decisions/reactions without the benefit of time to consider the ""karmic offset"" so to speak.

No idea if I explained that well at all."

I have it hanging up still today and that was maybe 5 years ago. It's one of my favorite things. Probably cost her like 5 dollars to make. 

My partner sews me things, like underwear, sweatpants, and today I'm wearing a shirt she made me yesterday while she was off work for the day. It fits me so great, made out of really pretty fabric, and it doesn't look like anything you'd see in a store. Swoon. I like stuff like that so much more than gifts. 

Other than that just quality time. I think men really value quality time connecting, just like women do. Yes intimacy is part of that, but it's not all of it. Intimacy is the best when you feel such a strong connection to your partner, and men crave that too. So if you create a special evening and spend time talking and laughing and having a good time and especially if it's orchestrated to lead to that, you literally feel on top of the world, the next day you have so much spring in your step.

He is pretty illiterate with technology so I had to email his police records to Canadian officials for him, because if any conviction carried a sentence of ten years or more for the equivalent crime in Canada he would be denied entry. He had convictions for kidnapping a teenage girl, and sexual assault. The convictions were over 40 years previously and he didn’t serve jail time as far as I’m aware. But damn that was a shock.

2025-08-14 18:51:08+00:00,"I mean, this bit is *based on* a true story.


Pretty much up until the “eureka moment,” most of it is true.


My only solution to the dog eating trash is to empty the can more frequently than you need to. 


But mainly, we use good ol fashioned toilet paper every time the girls pee, and most of the time we poop. And I’d be willing to bet my son (who is the main wet wipe user) flushes it half the time.



Honestly though, I’d recommend a diaper genie if you’re doing most of your shitting in one bathroom. We had two kids 19 months apart and the older of those two is developmentally delayed. Their older sister is three years older than the boy, so we had a diaper genie in the house for around 7 years. Half that time we were double duty, and those things did well to not smell bad with actual shit-filled diapers in them. 


I suspect with poop going down the pipes and just wipes in the DG, it wouldn’t ever stink if you cut the bag and tossed it weekly. A little Febreeze in there before you tie up the bag after."

I mean being silly, ""cringe"", funny, or immature in a lighthearted way.

I have this perception that after a certain age, especially if you have a job or a family, you have to act composed and serious at all times. Is that true? Will people judge or make fun of you for occasionally acting like your younger self, even if you're generally mature?

Sorry if this question seems silly, but it's something I really want to keep, even if it sometimes feels wrong,especially when adulthood comes with so many responsibilities and expectations.😅"

2025-08-14 18:53:04+00:00,"A friend and I were both having a hard time, so we decided to get drunk in her room and ended up hooking up. 

During foreplay, she told me to ""lick Tom Cruise,"" which was VERY confusing to my drunk ass. I was looking around for like a Tom Cruise poster or something when she yelled ""lick him! Lick Tom Cruise!"" and then used her fingers to make it clear that she meant her vagina. Still confusing, but I got it and obliged. 

Later she pushed me down on my back and said ""Pink Thunder, I want to torment you. Let me torment you!"" Alright, I'm into kink, so I'm down for this. So not knowing what was about to happen, I got ready as she climbed on and started riding me. I was waiting for the torment to start, and just as I thought she might have forgotten her plan to bring some pain into this, she starts riding faster and harder and leans down into my face yelling ""does it hurt!? DOES IT HURT!?"" This is REALLY funny in hindsight, but at the time it was strangely hot lol.

Also, the ENTIRE time we were hooking up she was doing a Russian accent lol

The next morning, I asked her why she called her vagina ""Tom Cruise,"" and she was like ""did I really do that? That's so weird and I have no idea."" Then I asked her about the ""torment/does it hurt"" thing, and she just laughed and was like ""I don't know, it's just something I do sometimes.""

We weren't exactly FWB. We were really good friends and only hooked up a couple more times over the years. She was one of the most zany, eccentric, fun people I've ever known. Kinda like a real life manic pixie dream girl. We would hang out all the time and it was always a blast.

A few years later, she got together with this guy who seemed sketch and her friends, me included, started seeing her less and less. I really wish I'd tried harder to intervene because  her becoming distanced from her friends was an obvious red flag, but, you can't force someone to leave a sketchy guy. Eventually he strangled her to death. It breaks my heart every time I think about her. She was so cool and we never had any drama or anything like that. Just a shit-load of fun and occasionally helping each other through tough times. It's been over a decade and I still think about her all the time and miss her dearly. I wish my wife  could have met her. She and my wife are both super whimsical and I think they would have loved each other."

One of my coworkers thought it made sense to get rid of the paper cups available for coffee and replace them with ceramic mugs. My other coworker came up to the first coworker, in front of me, and just started screaming at her to stay in lane and that it wasn’t her choice to make that change. I thought the second coworker was going to hit her. I had never seen anything so volatile, I ran to another coworker, who told me this happens a lot and just to ignore it.

The next day, he gave me a ridiculous excuse for not returning the Playstation, claiming that his boss had instructed him to demand an additional R200 before returning it. This was clearly a scam, and it was at this point that I realized that the driver had stolen my Playstation. Not only did I lose my Playstation, but I also gave the thief R200 to steal my Playstation

Father died in the altercation, and the 2 guys get charged with murder for having committed a felony during which someone died. The two guys got sentenced to death, and the supreme court ruled that even though they weren't involved in the murders, had no intent to commit murder, and had no previous thought about committing murder, they could be sentenced to death."

He was always *extremely* chill and wise in a funny way and I had heard he used to be an entertainer or something but it turned out to be so much more than that. He hired me and a couple friends to help paint his garage and when we were hanging out at his house we find the most ridiculous collection of pictures and memorabilia from his insane life. Over the years he had been a WW2 vet, a Harlem Globetrotter, a studio musician and a character actor who had lots of small bits in movies and TV shows. Well he was such a cool dude and he had worked in so many big industries that he had got to know a ton of huge stars from back in the day. He had photos of him at house parties and dinners with people like Robert Redford, Miles Davis, Richard Pryor, Kareem Abdul-Jabar etc. Like, *massive* stars in entertainment and sports from the 60s-70s.

2025-08-14 18:56:52+00:00,"I had a roleplay partner who was this person. For those who don't know, roleplaying is when two people collaboratively write stories, and they can sometimes be fanfiction-equivalent or be totally original. Each person creates/chooses their own characters and writes their reactions/actions, advancing the story. Like DnD with text only and no numbers.

My partner lived and breathed anime. She would discuss it at length like it was her one special interest. It seemed like she'd seem everything and had big opinions on all of them. Apparently she'd even tried to make an anime analysis YouTube at one point. I like anime, I've met people who are really into it, but she was a total type A who took it to the point of studying it like academia. She was *passionate.*

We ended up creating a behemoth of a story that would span several Google doc pages per post. She would joke that she had just gotten out of meetings and all she could think about was what had just happened in our story. Sometimes she would even post while she was at work in her phone despite the sheer length and quality- she was an *excellent* writer (and this was pre AI, no doubt it was authentic, she had a *voice*). I thought it was wild, I'd never met anyone so invested. Even though we spoke from dawn to dusk for months, it felt like she was always at work.

But as I got to know her, she told me about her job and it was way, way more prestigious than I thought. I was actually flooded; this was a girl who regularly said things like ""8'DDDDD YYYASSSSs omiGAAAWWGWHHDJSBSBSYSG"" to virtually anything. So I asked her ""what do you think your underlings would think if they found out you were a weeb who was thinking about anime boys with superpowers all day?""

She sent me a quick "">_>;;"", then proceeded to tell me a story about how she showed up to the company costume party in full Sasuke cosplay. That's how everyone found out.

We disconnected some months later because that's how it goes, but man, Im so sad I didn't get to be one of those people at the corporate party that found out their boss was an absolute Narutard. If only they knew she called herself ""boss lady >83"". When you look at her, you wouldn't guess it at all."

This should have been a red flag, but I ignored it. I thought that perhaps the money would show up later, so I gave the driver the Playstation. However, even after some time had passed, the money still had not appeared in my account. A few minutes later, the driver called me and informed me that MNISI had sent his brother to collect the Playstation, but he refused to pay the driver. As a result, the brother left, leaving the driver stranded without gas and with my Playstation. The driver asked if I could send him R200 for gas, promising to return the Playstation once he had it. I foolishly sent him the money, but he never showed up. I tried to call him, but he did not answer. The next day, he gave me a ridiculous excuse for not returning the Playstation, claiming that his boss had instructed him to demand an additional R200 before returning it. This was clearly a scam, and it was at this point that I realized that the driver had stolen my Playstation. Not only did I lose my Playstation, but I also gave the thief R200 to steal my Playstation

2025-08-14 18:58:06+00:00,"There are plenty of examples of what is a city problem:  
\* Gun Control - Cities have a lot of people, they also have a huge police presence, dialing 911 has someone at your doorstep within 5 minutes in a city like NYC, thats unrealistic in rural New York State.  
   \* This also includes self defense situations on things like wild life, you wont find a bear in downtown manhattan for example.  
\* Minimum Wage - A city like new york needs a much higher minimum wage then a rural town in upstate new york. If you force small businesses to have a 30 dollar minimum wage in upstate new york they go out of business because it doesnt match the cost of living in the area  
\* Land use and development - Cities have strict districting rules in order to manage and maintain the large populations they have, the countryside does not. This affects industrial and economic development of those small towns.  
\* Focus around mass transit - Cities benefit greatly while the country side sees little to no benefit, if you take their voice away you basically do taxation without real representation

Plenty more examples if you just google it but the point is that cities fundamentally care about different problems from rural communities. If you did a solely population based system, functionally yes, the needs of the many would outweigh the needs of the few, but realistically it would just hurt the countryside forcing more people to move into the cities which would make the current housing situation, job situation, and food situation much worse."

Her and I reconnected recently. What she told me had my jaw on the floor. He got them evicted from their apartment because he simply wasnt paying the rent. She and the roommate were giving him their share and he was partying it away. Her and my ex moved into his parents place but then he starts staying late at work and being suspicious. 


Turns out he got a DUI in his affair partners car end of October 2024. Affair partner is also an addict so 4 months of their relationship she was in rehab. They got engaged in May 2025 after being together 7 months. Affair partner is 25F and he is 38M. He's a line cook and she's the bartender.

This should have been a red flag, but I ignored it. I thought that perhaps the money would show up later, so I gave the driver the Playstation. However, even after some time had passed, the money still had not appeared in my account. A few minutes later, the driver called me and informed me that MNISI had sent his brother to collect the Playstation, but he refused to pay the driver. As a result, the brother left, leaving the driver stranded without gas and with my Playstation. The driver asked if I could send him R200 for gas, promising to return the Playstation once he had it. I foolishly sent him the money, but he never showed up. I tried to call him, but he did not answer. The next day, he gave me a ridiculous excuse for not returning the Playstation, claiming that his boss had instructed him to demand an additional R200 before returning it. This was clearly a scam, and it was at this point that I realized that the driver had stolen my Playstation. Not only did I lose my Playstation, but I also gave the thief R200 to steal my Playstation

They moved away, then I moved away and we lost touch. I googled her out of curiosity one day. Turns out, the dad had hidden cameras in the bathroom to record his kids and their friends. He also distributed these on the internet. FBI got him by requesting a naked video of a female family member (his daughter/my friend) for “verification” on an incest Kik group. The judge says he was the sickest individual they ever encountered. He is now rotting in federal prison for life. 

I cried so much when I learned this. I feel so bad for the kids and the mom who were completely blindsided by this. The kids adored their dad and he betrayed them in the most vile way possible. 

Btw, the victims were all minors. The footage raided had all been from their residence at that time (so not where I knew her from). There is no way of knowing when he started doing this. I’ll always wonder if his crimes occurred when I knew her. I had several sleep overs at her house and ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner at a table with this pile of human garbage.

If love or desire simmers down in my relationship, i can still find contentment in the warmth he brings into my life as a companion. I will cherish his presence in utmost respectable way.

And then people just make it worse by pitting male victims against female victims, when we should want to help each other. 

I honestly believe that society will begin to truly progress when everyone has the freedom to come forward with their stories of SA, from the smallest girl to the biggest, toughest man. Everyone deserves to talk about what was done to them.

If any male survivor happens to see this, I hope you know that your pain matters, and I hope you know that the shame belongs with the person who hurt you, NOT you. You deserve help, and peace. Please talk to someone instead of bottling it up where it will slowly kill you. You matter."

He was kind of weird but it's a comic book store, everyone is kind of weird.  

The store eventually sold to another friend of mine who decided he wanted to do everything instead of letting us set up shop so I didn't talk to him for a few months.  I think maybe 6 months after the store changed hands I got a collection of cards I don't normally buy and gave him a call. No answer.  I ran into another friend of his that weekend and he told me he had been arrested and been charged with extortion.  

Apparently this dude would make accounts on various social media sites, flirt with girls, get them to send him nudes and then threaten them with their release unless they did things for him.  Since he did it online the government decided to make him an example for one of the first major cyber-extortion cases and he earned himself a healthy 17 and a half years for it. A few of the girls were 17 at the time so they stuck him with distribution of child pornography, extortion of a minor. I know a ton of weird people, but I never really expected him to have some sort of organized extortion racket going on. It was a shock to say the least."

I say that because you are acknowledging a failing and vocalizing it.  It is a very vulnerable position to put yourself in and you are entirely at the mercy of the person to whom you are apologizing.  It requires the lowering of the ego, which is hard if not impossible for some people to do.

We were on an island and an unexpected change gave us about 4 days of free time and we couldn't leave, so we booked a a deep-sea fishing cruise; got two boats. It was fun and we caught a fuck ton of fish. Our boat got three or four, 6-foot Wahus, a large grouper, and a couple of barracudas. The other boat caught a *190-lb* bluefin tuna, plus some other fish.  

A nearby restaurant on the island would clean and cook any catches for you, all for only $15 seat and they served it up in every way imaginable.

I didn't really have a choice since that was the only protein available, so I just dove in and *loved it*, especially the tuna sashimi. Everything was crazy delicious, i liked the Cajun-style and the sashimi the most. It drove my ex nuts because she couldn't ever get me to try seafood but here I was, a now converted afficianado."

I come with promotable experience, and they choose not to hire me, but instead hire people who are 5 or 10 years younger…  

None of us are really concerned how it goes for the company, but it says a lot of negative stuff about a companies management team if they don’t have a proper way to on-board personnel from within the company— who only need to learn some of the more basic shit about the role to which they want to be promoted—, but have procedures in place for bringing on completely fresh people to the company regardless of their work experience outside of it. 

I will say this though… One thing about nearly all of the supervisors we have, save for two, is that they are aesthetically attractive.  If it weren’t for the two outliers, I might be inclined to bring up the discrepancy with the labor board."

2025-08-14 19:01:27+00:00,"I was in the Army for 6 years back in 08-14. The benefits of service have been palpable. There still exists veterans preference in many ""civilian government"" positions, that I have personally benefited from.

The key thing to remember is, they need to take advantage of education opportunities while they are still in. I knew people who got bachelors degrees without even touching their GI Bills.

They also need to plan for the future BEFORE they exit the military. Going to school? Okay, what school, what major, when do you start, etc...getting a job after? Have you interviewed with the company, do you have a start date, etc...

I basically walked out the gate with no plan, so initially it was a struggle (and it didn't need to be).

I've heard talk about VA benefits getting cut. I haven't personally seen it. I know they've gotten rid of staff at VA hospital, the benefits so far remain intact. That would probably be very inadvisable to change Vets benefits.

Being in kinda sucked. I missed weddings, graduations, birthdays, holidays. You have to listen to people who sometimes are complete fucking idiots. My MOS/""job"" doesn't exactly transfer into the civilian world at all. But, I do have some of the most epic stories.

If I could do it again, I would probably try and choose a different job. I'd personally stay away from tech related jobs. I'd go toward the medical side (maybe a Medic, etc), even a wheeled vehicle mechanic...
Keep in mind it's a job you're going to have to do for at least 3-4 years. You can't quit if you don't like it and you typically can't change it until your contract is over.

As far as the current administration goes...he's a real loon. What he's going to do or not do is a serious wrinkle that should be considered...and I can't really answer that part of it...it's a risk for sure. But, I joined during the surge in Iraq so...

  I think medication would help but idk I just wanna get through this and I feel like if I figure out how to do it without medication I wont fall to addiction ever again, it's like the bus scenario I agree but if I was a hardcore hard drugs addict it would be even worse of addiction I would have to decline I feel like if I didn't want to introduce more problems I have to deal with later (extreme cravings)
  Often I think of a study I heard of idk where but with mice, it went something along the lines of when the mouse was alone and had nothing really except normal water and opioid water it would always choose the opioid water until it died, but when the opioid water was introduced into a ""mice utopia"" I guess you could say, noone overdosed, I reflect often on this study, I really should look into it more and similar studies but yea idk."

In germany I'd never have to pay for water (like tap water costs a few Cents, okay). Also I would argue the topic qith living space. You just have to be drug addicted and/or totally out of mind to be homeless in germany, also our Houses are made way more solid, even in the most shittiest place here 👀. Medical care? Bruh..wuth respect. Your docs are slightly more qualified but nobody has to pay their Cancer medicine or any other necessary Thing here if you're not able to pay for it. Also you dont have to pay a lot for dentists. If you earn well you can still ""purchase"" better Services. Last one: You would not be able to comprehend what we are doing to our public Infrastructure so every handicaped can enter every building and get every Service he needs. 

Especially in the comparison of medical care (eldery included), education and accesibility of bare minimum of living Standards and gouvermental Support, USA is rly far from a developed country. 
Honestly, your doing good in capitalism and their results: it looks like every peasant (not disrespectful) can afford a house with a pool in many many places, affird big Trucks, afford way cheaper flights and so on. You are also good at Military and in beeing a superpower - I'm honest! I think the USA is doing what it takes to be there years from now and that a better living Standard would be too expensive and offensive to your kind of capitalism.

How have they gone about testing you for endometriosis? Anything shy of a laparoscopic surgery is not definitive, there’s no other way to rule it out. Unfortunately the treatments all suck for it, the only thing that helped my pelvic pain was to have my uterus and one ovary removed. If you’re having really debilitating periods I would push for an exploratory lap to see if that’s what’s going on. If it comes on all of a sudden and goes away just as quick that could be the lightning like pains common with endo (it usually feels like your butthole got struck by lightning). 

If it’s a more persistent issue I would see your doc for a pelvic exam next time you’re experiencing it so they can check for sores."

Its hard too, because my family has been taking advantage of me for years, and its my girl who's helping me see this and encouraging me to start my own life, and her support is making it possible to really change my mindset about things I previously would not have done because I didn't know any better.

**Early awareness:**Research shows that the oil and gas industry, through its trade association the American Petroleum Institute (API), has known about the potential for human-caused global warming since at least the 1950s. 

Gun control - you can't address the mental state because any such law is an infringement on the 2nd amendment, you also can't mandate training or continual recertification or lists of who owns guns or impose restrictions on things like bump-stocks, you can't even mention the bit that states its for a 'well regulated militia'  
  
Economics - which side notes the disparity between billionaires and the 99%?  Or even talks about it? You can play 'whataboutism' until you're blue in the face, but I cannot think of a single major GOP member even trying to reduce the income gap - heck, the president is now saying we simply need to round up the homeless.   
  
Societal - if you can't see which party has largely been against the help of minority and marginalized groups, I do not have enough space to correct that.  I cannot, for example, name one Democratic leader of prominence who claimed entire groups of people were murders and rapists.

  
Constitution - it cannot be changed due to ONE party who will not even think about doing it, they think a group of men hundreds of years ago had the foresight to think of a time when muskets and flintlocks would be replaced with weaponry that can lay waste to scores in mere moments.  They also were creating this document right after a revolution and in a country still populated by a native population that largely didn't care for the presence of the colonists - none of that is even considered - even though Jefferson said it should be rewritten every 19 years to service the current generation."

Blink of an eye, I drove by the semi truck, light were blinking, I assumed I'm seeing the driver working under the truck on something, and almost in slow motion, I drove by and saw his body under the truck, one chalk in place by the back wheel.

His head was under the tire, blood everywhere, and I kept driving because I was 16, only place closest was my high school, and nobody was there (before cell phones).

I told my coach, they called police and it was taken care of before school even began that day. I know I couldn't help what had already happened, but I'd never  witnessed something like that without help already there."

And even worse now you have a bunch of houses that people can't afford to live.  You need to build the projects not houses:)  And we don't need more doctors.

2025-08-14 19:05:47+00:00,"That’s a really good question.

I suppose the first book that comes to mind is ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert Sapolsky, as it presented the intersectionality of human psychology and evolutionary biology in a way that I had never before thought about, and I learned a great deal from it. I think a lot of the insights I gained from reading that book genuinely fuel my curiosity and desire to keep learning and studying the mind. It also showed me that a career in academia is probably what’s most desirable to me.

However, though not a book, Friedrich Nietzsche’s “On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense” is probably the most important piece of writing I have ever read. I’ve never read anything that has been so layered and detailed, yet so compact. Every time I reread the essay, I swear there is more I take away. Though certainly a bit of interpretation is required to understand what is being said, I largely think it is very accessible text that reveals so much about human society and language and the ways that we construct the world around us in a way that is relative to our perceptual constraints rather than in a way that is aligned with absolute truth and objective reality. This essay extends so far into the realms of linguistic anthropology and psychology that it’s hard to believe it precedes both fields
(I think, though I could be mistaken)."

Then last month, he got arrested at work by some sheriffs. My first thought was probably selling coke on the side due to money problems. 

He was accused of taking upskirt photos of women at Walmart. Cops were called and confiscated his phone. Turns out it was true because they found a bunch of attempts and a video of him jerking off into women's underwear at that Walmart.

2025-08-14 19:06:41+00:00,"I had a manager we referred to as 'the tyrant.' She had previously been on the team for longer than anyone else (about 8 years) and basically was the Dwight Schrute of wanting a promotion and applying for any and every opportunity to take some kind of power role. When her manager finally got promoted she applied for her job and although her manager advised against it she got the team manager position. Per our department manager she 'showed she wanted it more than anyone.' Our team listened to those calls that were recorded for 'quality assurance.'

Here is the list of grievances against her in her first year:

* She would relay updates by walking among our cubicles screaming at the top of her lungs like a town cryer and if you didn't hear what she was saying because you were listening to a recorded call (you know you're job) you would be yelled at for being 'disrespectful' for asking her to repeat herself.
* Our top performer had previously been a team manager in the department and stepped down after having her daughter due to stress. She was FAR more knowledgeable and had over 20 years in the department under her belt. This made the manager insecure and one day after the girl corrected her on giving us incorrect information she handed her a white box and told her to pack her things. The girl called corporate HR and found out she was actually not fired and advised to return to work if she would like. She instead hired a lawyer and received a 3 year salary settlement. The manager still had her job.
* She would go through our desks at night and if you had any medication in there, prescription or not, she would throw it away. The next day you'd get spoken to about how 'poisonous' that is for your body and she'd try to get you to buy essential oils from the MLM she was in deep on. HR did not care.
* She also bragged about the fact that children's services was called on her because when her son broke his arm and they had to take him to the emergency room she got into a fight with the medical staff about giving him pain meds and not letting her put oil on him. He went into shock and she considered it a result of the peace that the 'scent of the oil' brought him.
* 3 people walked out tired of the power trip leaving us with 3 people to complete the same expected daily workload one of whom had only been on the team a few weeks and was still learning. I as a result took on 3xs my workload to help cover as much as I could. She asked me to do more work, and I told her I would try if I could. I was working non-stop, completing more than anyone else with the highest accuracy rate and they would not offer us OT to make up the difference so I was not going to work past my shift. I came in one day to her pulling me into a conference room to just scream at me for about 30 minutes and giving me a 'write up' that I needed to 'work harder.' She wouldn't define for me what that meant. HR confirmed there was no official write up on my file, but again would do nothing.
* Word got around the company and NO ONE would apply for our, internal hire only, team role so we could not back fill.
* On my 5 year anniversary I walked in and she said, 'wow 5 years surprised you'd made it this long.' I said 'you know what you're right.' I handed her my badge and walked out. She asked me where I planned to go and I said 'anywhere but here.'
* Last I heard she is still in that position and has not gone anywhere... that was 10 years ago."

Beneficial, can tell when a predator is getting up on you. Patch of slightly curved light-sensitive cells? Even better, you can have a bit of directionality to the light. More and more curved, until you reach the point it can be a hole filled with liquid? Can have much clearer and defined images. Etc etc.

2025-08-14 19:08:13+00:00,"This is an extremely niche response, and most people won’t identify with it, but I think that those who can will agree. 

I’ve been saying for years that the most intimate thing that two people can do with their clothes on is break out a young horse. 

Hear me out. I’ll describe it for those who don’t know. The first time a young horse has a rider on its back, typically two people are involved: the rider, and the ground person. At this point, the ground person should have done a considerable amount of ground work and desensitization with the horse to get them to the point of being ready to accept a rider. Contrary to what you see in cowboy movies, the first time a horse is ridden it should absolutely not act like a wild bronc, and the rider isn’t there to ride it out until the horse is exhausted and gives up. For the first few rides, the rider is literally just human shaped weight on the horse, and is totally at the mercy of the horse and the ground person. The rider has zero control whatsoever and is putting 100% of their trust in the ground person’s control of the horse based on the groundwork that has already been done. Of course, sometimes unexpected things happen and the horse could react fearfully to the situation. When this happens, it happens FAST and can be extremely dangerous for everyone involved. The ground person could get trampled, the rider could get thrown, the horse could bolt off, it could even rear up and flip over backwards on top of the rider. So both people have to be completely in tune with the horse and its body language, and also with each other and their respective body language. There usually isn’t time to vocalize anything before something goes wrong, it happens that fast. They essentially have to be able to communicate with each other without words while staying on the same page about what’s going on. 

When two people are so in tune with each other, it makes the process something beautiful. Like ballet. Effortless, seamless, graceful. You really learn a lot about the other person without speaking any words. 

On the contrary, when two people don’t work well together and aren’t in tune with each other, it can be a real clusterfuck"

This is 15 years ago and there is just no way you haven’t stumbled on the truth somewhere along the way so you’re doing this on purpose.  Just no way you’re not purposefully lying about this. Why?

The state department didn’t sell any uranium to Russia. Nobody did. A Russian company bought a Canadian company. A committee approved the deal unanimously. The state department has one vote in that committee. There is no indication Hillary had anything to do with or even knew about the deal. 

Even the conspiracy is weak.. this small rubber stamp on a business deal? The Clintons are so so dirty. Why are you talking about Hillary simply being a lawyer and a bunch of other unrelated things.  I’m sure they did many more favors for that money than this invented nonsense.

In the case of matter disintegration and compilation, your original mind and body is essentially erased and a copy (from just before you get zapped) is built at the destination.

So in essence, you won't even achieve or enjoy what you set up to do, but your copy does. Quite a few games and novels bring this up. But yes, the Sun for me since there's no round trip."

We are both in good health and average fitness. Both of them go through phases of depression and my wife often just does not feel sexy. In her past, she experienced a bad sexual assault (rape). This left her with ptsd. That combined with her image issues, it can be difficult for her. I always make her feel safe, loved, and supported. Part of the lack of sex is definitely my fault. I find her lack of confidence to be a turn-off, and we dont have the same love language. I enjoy touch, for play, long hot exploration sessions. She tells me she wants short, quick, efficient sex. In the end, we usually just take care of our own needs and support and love each other. It's not conventional, but it still works for us."

The statistics of married men , or men in a relationship with a female, having a casual encounter now and then with a gay guy are extremely high. Its so common and normal these days. It happens in just about every town, city, state , country there is. And guess what. The majority say the only reason they do see a guy ince in awhile is because thier wives or female partners wont have sex with them anymore .  There have been polls taken by the wives and girlfriends of men and hypothetically were asked if there man were to have sex with someone other , would they want it to be with another guy , or another woman.

This could be a flippant answer but it is not. I learned to make arrowheads in a four hour class, at the end of which I could produce the crudest, most lopsided and misshapen arrowhead imaginable. It was really fun.

Our hominid ancestors  made stone tools for three million years, or more. This is such a long time that the knowledge of making stone tools could have actually been encoded in our genome, except it wasn't. 

Hunting and gathering behavior is definitely encoded in our being.  From actual sport hunting, to games like Easter Egg hunts or geocacheing, we love searching for things that could be valuable once found. We are even entertained by finding Waldo. Hominids have been huntíng and gathering for a long, long time.  But flint knapping should be as core to our being. Try it if you can find a class It is fascinating."

Not because of the change in my body, but because he felt he wasn’t good enough anymore. It surprised me that men often feel pretty similar as women. They want to feel desired and wanted. Not just a pogo stick to bounce on. Try breaking the ice and see how he responds. Obviously it can’t all be on you all the time but maybe he’s just scared you’ll reject him and that’s why he distanced himself. His hand on you at night suggests to me the desire is there. As ridiculous as my hub’s suggestion is, that actually did work. A little caressing, a little leg wrapping action, some nuzzling on his neck…then boom, hello monsieur. He was back and even more romantic than before. He needed me to initiate because of how self conscious he felt and sometimes words just aren’t enough. Think of his hand on you like he’s reaching out for help. He needs you to pull him back in. 

Obviously this could all be crap, there’s no way for me to know the intricacies of your relationship. But it’s a fairly harmless way to try. The worst that could happen is feeling disappointed and coming to the realization that something more is going on. Which is something that is better to realize sooner rather than later.

When I talk about physical addiction, I mean that you will have physical withdrawal symptoms should you stop taking the substance due to your body going into shock. Obviously, these symptoms vary depending on the person and how long they've been doing it/ how much their body has adapted to it. 

Long-time alcoholics can have seizures if they quit drinking suddenly. That's on the severe end, but some of the mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms overlap with sugar such as headaches, inability to sleep, trouble concentrating, irritability, and tremors."

What is different is the interpretation of said information.

2025-08-14 19:12:39+00:00,"I hate it. My love language is touch, so while my wife says she loves me and she will show it in other ways, such as gifts or thinking of me or sacrifices in that regard, it doesn't have a huge impact on me. 

I would sacrifice all of that for her to just touch me. I don't need her to buy me gifts, or make me dinners/lunches, or whatever. I just want her to touch me.  

I feel very ugly and undesirable. To the point I won't look at my body in the mirror. I can't stand to be naked, definitely not near her. She will be in the bathroom and I'll have to get in the shower and I do everything I can to try and makes sure she can't see me because I just feel ugly and unwanted. I will literally walk into the shower clothed and undress in there and toss my clothes over the barrier.  

It's all super sad but divorce would equal bankruptcy. It is just not economically possible. So whatever, i'm half done this life, maybe in the next one I'll be luckier."

2025-08-14 19:12:43+00:00,"Do you mean why do they look different?  It's mostly because of the way the pelvis of your average women differs from your average man, which is because of the effect of sex hormones like testosterone.  More testosterone and less estrogen, and you get the kind of pelvis that is more typical of men.  Less testosterone and more estrogen, and you get the wider and more tilted kind of pelvis that is more typical of women.

  
(Fun fact: all medically normal human bodies produce both testosterone and estrogen; the sex-linked difference is in the *amounts* of each.)

  
There are other factors at play, like fat distribution, but it's mostly the skeletal structure."

2025-08-14 19:12:53+00:00,"It took a long time, but when I was in my early 20’s I had drinks with my brother and friend while I was home on leave. During the drinks my brother’s friends shows up and was supposed to be meeting someone there. That person flaked so she hung out with us for the night. Before leaving I stood up, checked my phone and said “damn, that’s not good”, and she replied “what’s wrong?”, “my phone doesn’t have your number in it”. She gave me her number but had a boyfriend who she had a kid with and married shortly after.

20ish years later I saw her at an Alice Cooper concert, she was working at the venue and I was attending, we briefly spoke and went out ways. 

3-4 years after that I’m single and on the apps. I see her and swipe right and we matched. On our first date she said she always found my line cute and that she was expecting something but not that and she liked that it worked. We dated briefly but meh."
