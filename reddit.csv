After my dad retired, he took a part time job working the night shift at a nursing home. i told him that he needed to have a regular sleep schedule but he insisted on being awake during the days and sleeping at night on his days off. He didn't last long at that job.

Another thing that's crazy to me is when businesses insist on rotating workers through different shifts. The son of a coworker works a job where he is 2 weeks on days, two weeks on swings and 2 weeks on nights and then cycles back. I guess the kid likes it but it would drive me nuts because I would never adapt in time to the new sleep schedule every two weeks.

I loved working nights, especially when the shift moved from 9pm to 6am to 6pm to 3 am. I wish I could work that shift now. I have to admit that it would have sucked during the time my wife and I were raising our kids, though."

2025-08-14 17:14:14+00:00,"There‚Äôs a difference between believing there is hope for redemption and a knowing you have a guaranteed get of jail free card. 

Everything is going to be situational. If someone is having months long emotional and physical affair,  that is a fundamentally different kind of cheating than someone who fucks up and has a one night stand and that‚Äôs it nothing more. Neither are totally excusable but one is definitely a less severe form of cheating and more 

If the months long cheater comes clean, that‚Äôs inherently less genuine and more like playing their get of jail free card because they had months to reflect on their decision. Whereas a person who had a one night stand, reflected on their actions over the next week, and then came clean are going to appear significantly more genuine/remorseful and perhaps more worthy of forgiveness than the first guy

Now if the cheater knows there is 0 hope of redemption, then the one night stand guy may be more likely to either go to great lengths to hide their actions or continue cheating because the consequences will be the same regardless. Without any hope of redemption, you might as well go cheat 100 times more because you messed up once since the consequences will be the exact same for cheating once vs cheating 100 times"

2025-08-14 17:14:19+00:00,"Never said that all homeless people are on drugs. It is, however, a major reason why so many people become and stay homeless. 

If you have any knowledge of the legal system at all, you'll see over and over and over again how people refuse to get jobs, refuse to look for higher-paying work, refuse to prioritize finding stable employment over very sporadic gig work, refuse to go to drug treatment, refuse to contribute to their household when they live with another person, and refuse to pursue education so they can get a better job. 

Most of the people in the legal system are either homeless or are totally reliant on other people to pay the bills and refuse to make a serious effort to get a stable job and find a real career.

Whether you like it or not, the failure to care about the direction of one's life and failure to care about being a productive member of society is a significant reason why people become homeless. They just don't care to better their lives at all. I've seen this over and over and over.

Getting a good job does take serious effort. The reality is that most people simply just don't want to put in the effort to better their lives, and that's why so many people end up on the margins of society."

2025-08-14 17:14:21+00:00,">How men can harm women, children, animals, anything physically weaker than them. Men are supposed to naturally be protectors, so wtf?

I don't see the contradiction here. If men are ""natural protectors"", what exactly are they protecting their loved ones from? Other men, other women, other animals, who would do their loved ones harm.

It's funny, but to be a protector, you must necessarily be willing to inflict harm on things weaker than yourself... because things weaker than yourself may try to inflict harm on those you wish to protect.


...that being said, I do agree that macho behavior is stupid and has the opposite effect as intended. I see a ""big tough guy"" pushing someone around to show off his strength, and I have no respect for him."

2025-08-14 17:15:10+00:00,"I was nips deep in my slut phase when I met my now wife. And tbf for those first couple years it was pretty frequent. But when she had her manic episode and then started with therapy and medication so many complex feelings came up and it started feeling like she was doing it lovingly out of some sense of duty. I felt like another man that was demanding her body to display her worth. It disgusted me. We've been struggling with that back and forward for almost 4 years now. She tries and pushes herself and when I feel like it isnt her being there out of love the responsibility is on me to stop it and remind her that her feelings are more important and we can bang the rest of our lives but in a loving way not a duty way. We're not truly sexless, but likely quarterly do we have full sex.

That said to say it isnt a struggle would be a lie. Like many guys physical touch was and is a primary form of feeling love. Its an affirming way that im reminded that I am loved and cared for. Ive been in therapy for a minute and have realized the non sexual things she does to make me feel taken advantage of or dismissed which only compounds when I have to face that sexual frustration. So not only identifying these things but realizing that I have never let her know that these are needs of mine. So I feel like removing the quick fix of sex has made me do inner work to stand up and hold my boundaries else where. Its also made me realize how intensely ill shut down when I feel alone and how to express that without attacking her. Anyway next week is 6 years been together almost 10. The companionship is unmatched and ive never felt safe exploring my vulnerabilities while being in a relationship before her, so that really helps the struggles. At the end of the day were a team and I cant help bear responsibility for her psychological struggles so why would I make her bear responsibility for my sexual struggles? If it ever felt like we weren't together in these struggles im not sure we would be as strong as we are. If it turns out to be fundamental to me and I can't live healthy without frequent sex then we will cross that bridge when we get there. But I feel like progress is happening in this path."

I mean, he literally bought a hat from a guy, like off his head, and threw it down on the ground where he murdered his wife. He was willing to set up an innocent person, completely screwing them with making sure their property was at a crime scene.

I lived in the area and had friends and family working at Northridge Mall. Security was walking people to their cars at night after work, and extra police patrols went through. We were so invested in the details for obvious reasons.  

I remember when I heard the radio announcement about Dahmer and Anderson. I had moved far away from Milwaukee by that time, but when they said Jesse Anderson, I remembered that crazy week of heightened security."

2025-08-14 17:16:26+00:00,"I was going out with a guy, we'd been together for about a year or so and I really, really liked him. I knew he had bad anxiety, but was seeing a therapist and I thought was coping with it. He was moving house, had lost a diary or something (he kept therapeutic diaries then shredded them) and he was beside himself with worry about not finding it. I was like, eh oh well, I'm sure if someone finds it in the future they'll just chuck it away.

He then told me that he'd touched his friend's sister when they were younger, and I assumed if was some teenage hijinks. You know, felt a bit bad, but it was 2 young people fooling around. Nope, turns out he went into the room of a 6-7 year old girl and molested her in her own bed. He was 16 or so.

I broke up with him soon afterwards, told my supervisor (one of my clients was an adult survivor of childhood abuse, so I was reeeeeally quite upset about the whole thing). She said it was so long ago, I had no proof etc but I did the right thing in telling her.

Ever since then, a few things have made me wonder if he told me everything. I know some people with OCD get intrusive thoughts about being a paedo, but this guy once called in sick because he accidentally saw some adult porn on a Google AI thing. He also made a comment about his therapist being uncomfortable when he bumped into her with her kids. Or something. Anyway, yes that the most shocked I've ever been, and it made me feel icky for a long while as I am very short and young-looking. I also felt guilty and shit for being upset when it was someone else who was hurt, but I've never felt that 'switch' flick so quickly from loving someone to being repulsed by them."

Fascism by definition means: ‚ÄúA system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent governmental controls, violent suppression of the opposition, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism‚Äù.

An example of a true Fascist government would be Italy from ~1922-1943. Not the USA now. 

The US is set up in such a way were a dictatorship is very very hard to obtain, which was the whole point the writing of the constitution and its supporting articles.

It was so out of the blue so I told my best friend who also had a falling out with her. I wasn't sure if I was going to engage with her but we were curious what the ulterior motive was. I responded thank you and asked how she was doing. Her response was that her husband was arrested. Of course I shared this with my best friend before responding because we had no idea what it could be. He was a nerd and super nice. We concluded that it was likely DUI since he was a drinker. I ended up googling it and I found something saying his house was raided at 5am for CSAM. We did not expect that. 

Looking back things we thought were a little weird started to make sense. His wife perpetually tried acting younger than her age (also a Disney adult) and they were together since high school, he was a computer guy with a bunch of computers that she wasn't supposed to use, he didn't want his own kids and the reason was convoluted. The affidavit we found stated he was downloading it from the dark web. She was difficult to be friends with for a variety of reasons but she didn't deserve to have her life upended like that.

2025-08-14 17:17:30+00:00,">your beloved

This right here is the problem. A lot of ""beloveds"" aren't actually beloved anymore. The paradigm has shifted, and they're viewed as a burden, a chore, another (adult) child, another stressor of some sort. They're just another thing making them miserable somehow. Until that characterization changes, it's hard to fix intimacy issues. 

And social media (the root of many problems in modern society) does little to dissuade this. I promise I don't mean this in any kind of incel-y way, but social media is rife with vilifying men these days. Buzzwords that others have gotten from therapy, misapplied, bastardized, and said around have become commonplace. All of that ultimately serves to reinforce this idea that their partner is the source of the breakdown in the relationship, and justify refusing to participate in a cooperative effort to fix things until the man changes somehow. 

And don't get me wrong, the man may legitimately be doing something wrong. But it still takes two to fix a relationship, and effort from both sides, and a willingness to fix it. Resting on ""My partner is the cause of this problem and needs to fix it or I'm not participating in the relationship!"" regardless of gender is a failing strategy."

No matter the remorse you yourself have to be at peace with yourself first. If you have enough confidence in yourself you can see this hurts a lot less unless you're just an arrogant fool and you're the master of your own undoing and because of that the partner cheated in the first place.

When that was too hard to keep up, there was 0 sex life and I thought I was the problem (no communication and would freeze up if I even brought it up in a soft respectful tone.) in my head, we grew apart. Or she simply didn't have the ability of commitment after her previous relationship. 

Here is a link I found that helped me understand a little more, on what I saw happening in the relationship. She may have seen it differently, but she's not as perceptive:

Being smart is the same, some people are smart in math, some English, some biology. There isn't one objective truth that we can all use for a 1-10 scale.

He got caught the first time, apologized, blah blah blah, switched parishes, people including his wife forgave him. Then he did it again.

They always had a hard time staffing, so some of the hires were beyond sketch. 

One day, my teammates and I were on a client call when all of the sudden a huge brawl broke out - the building had an open atrium and tile floors, so it just echoed through the entire place. Chairs were thrown over the balcony, wigs were ripped off, the whole nine. We had to reschedule our call because it was so loud. 

Turns out, one agent got mad at another over a hot dog and went home at lunch, picked up three friends and came back and jumped them. Needless to say, our building security was upgraded shortly thereafter.

Another incident also involved a call center agent - I was chatting with my boss when I noticed a bunch of cops show up in the parking lot. Of course I‚Äôm nosey as hell, so I get up and watch to see what was going to happen.

Turns out, one of the call center agents had broken into someone‚Äôs house the night before - the homeowner came home and surprised him, and he stabbed them to death. Then came to work the next day, as you do.

It was mayhem there while we had the contact center (the eventually moved it to another unit out of state). At least one person was LIVING in the building for about two weeks before anyone caught them."

My last ex, I was very attracted to and we were able to have a bit more fun since i was trying to waych less porn. However, porn caused me to have unrealistic ideas about sex. A mix between performance anxiety and porn is just not great. 


I havent watched any porn in 3 months and ive already noticed that im looking at women and think about having sex with them. My sex drive has gotten better, as well as my confidence. When I masterbate, I just use my imagination and I find that more rewarding.

He was about my age, early to mid 40s) and ask me to exchange a bunch of coins for a $20 bill. It's against store policy(were not a bank is what the owner has told us.) 

I tell the guy ""no, sorry we can't open the till and make change like that"" he kept asking, and suggested he buy something to get the till open.

 I had politely told him no in 3 or 4 different ways, when my younger female coworker walked into the kitchen from the back. He quietly said to me ""wow, they hire them cuter and cuter these days"" 

That was it for me, I'd had enough of this non-customer and told him ""no, that's not ok, you can leave now"" he was confused and asked why? I told him ""I don't appreciate the comment you made about my teenaged coworker, and you can get out now""

His eyes went wide, and he started profusely trying to say ""I didn't know she was a teenager, I'm sorry"" at that point I was like ""dude, it's too late, you've made the comment, can't take it back. You can leave, and don't bother coming back""

She was actually 21, but like 4'5"", petite. She's a badass, and could have handled herself, but it was gross, and my papa bear side came out. Haven't seen him around since."

No one test can tell you whether your child is healthy or not. If you have questions or concerns please feel free to call me or talk to your primary care provider.""

Childhood obesity is definitely still a problem, exacerbated by the COVID lockdown. I happen to be in massachusetts, where the problem is not as big, but it is still worth addressing.

**20 years ago I was a weird fat 15 year old kid living in a small town & I just spent all my time online.**¬†

**Became obsessed with noise music, gore movies, etc.** 

**On soulseekt & IRC all day. Came across a girl that was roughly my same age into the same stuff and we became basically e-bffs - chatted every day on AIM. She was bright, had a promising future. There were moments of romantic tension and remember trying to plot going to some noise festival with her and finally meeting but it never materialized. Around the time I was 19 and got my first girlfriend she got into drugs & derailed her life. Eventually lost all contact with her**

  
**Throughout my 20s I would think of her every so often & once every few years I'd try to look her up on social media or google but there was nothing, she was a ghost.**¬†

  
**When I did it this year I came across a federal indictment on the US Department of Justice Website. She is accused of running a transnational white power terrorist group, Terrorgram. She‚Äôs facing almost 250 years in prison - for soliciting hate crimes, the murder of federal officials, providing material support to terrorists.**¬†"

2025-08-14 17:25:21+00:00,"Whatever works! At the same time I would say it's often fruitless to try and strong-arm motivation for ADHD folks. 

Enticing it usually works better. That can be adding something pleasant into an unpleasant task (music on your ears while doing a manual task), or roping someone in for accountancy. Doing as little as telling them ""I'm gonna do that now"" can help, because knowing they know adds weight to the outcome, even if they don't provide negative feedback. Making lists and breaking down big tasks into small items is super helpful. Make that list out in the open, a board or a piece of paper that's pinned up somewhere, so there's zero barriers to seeing it, and no way to close it up.

That's far from being an exhaustive list, and nothing is going to work every time. With ADHD you can only nudge your odds in a positive direction. 

It's worth noting that ""neurotypical"" people (at this point I'm doubtful that's actually a thing but let's go with it) do not strong arm their motivation either. They just have better built in enticement. They get reliable precursor rewards when they think about starting a task that's essentially ""remember how good it felt last time you did that? Here's a sample"" and more rewards throughout, and at the end. They follow a trail of feel good/feel right that leads them through the tasks they want to accomplish."

I didn't even know his birthday until I read his obituary.

My eldest sister, we've never been close. we did not get along when we were growing up. we almost get along now, but we are more long distance close. she's the ""only call on big days"" ( birthdays, major holidays) type, and I'm okay with that.

my older sister ( she's the middle kid) I get along with great. we don't talk everyday, but we do call frequently. we tell each other our secrets, and I'm close to her husband and her kid. 

the funny thing is, my sisters are only a year apart, and there are 5 years between me and my oldest sister, and 4 between me and my other sister. so I don't think it's an age thing, but more that my and my eldest sister's personalities just clash."

He looked the part. Gang tattoos, shaved head, silver teeth. Looked a decade older than he was. Absolutely looked like a gang banger. At 6‚Äô3‚Äù and around 275, he was physically intimidating. 

That being said, he is absolutely the nicest guy. Very kind and respectful and obviously in love with my cousin. Cousin had been dealt a tough hand (absent father and a chronically ill mother, and an ex husband that abandoned her when she was pregnant) so to see her with someone that adores her and was so wonderful with her daughter just made us all so happy. 

He took administrative classes while he was in prison and has used that to work his way up to a supervisor position at a local hospital. He runs outreach programs at the juvenile detention center. After he and my cousin got married, he adopted her daughter and they have a little boy that‚Äôs almost a year old.

True, however to be a true protector you have to with-hold harming a weaker thing unless it becomes a threat. 

A man deciding to r\*pe a woman he sees getting off a bus does not see her as a ""threat"" and has to do that to her to protect himself or others. He does it because he wants to. 

A man beating his wife daily does not see her as a threat to himself, he does it because he wants to/cannot control himself. 

I can understand your point of harming something/someone weaker than a man to protect those he cares for, but I am talking about regular everyday harm which many men unfortunately do (I am not bashing men or saying all men do these things). 

I also know that women can harm weaker men/children/animals and I don't agree with that either however it is more prevalent in men to do so and I just don't understand why."

At the time, we had a close knit group of friends that we‚Äôd travel with all the time. There were about 6-12 couples in the group at any given time, and you know how that goes - you‚Äôre going to absolutely adore some of them, but there‚Äôs always one or two people you aren‚Äôt all crazy about. One of the men always made me feel uncomfortable: he‚Äôd met his wife (such a sweet woman) overseas while he was in the military, she was always incredibly subservient to him, called him ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù (just ICK), and she wasn‚Äôt allowed to do anything on her own except go to work. I always jokingly (but serious) told my husband that that guy was someone I‚Äôd never want to get stuck in an elevator with. He just creeped me TF out. One day, without warning, this couple suddenly packed up, sold their house, and moved to another state, saying they‚Äôve just always wanted to live there. I called bullshit on the whole thing because they were enormously entrenched where they lived and in all the time we‚Äôd spent with them, they‚Äôd never mentioned moving. Moreover, they were so tight lipped about all of it, I knew something was up. (The wife was not allowed to talk about it to anyone, and I remain convinced that she never knew the whole truth).

Fast forward to a couple of years later: I was visiting a relative and we‚Äôd returned home from dinner. We sat down on the couch and turned the TV on while we chatted about our day. That‚Äôs when I heard his voice. I turned to the TV to see that man on security camera footage. He was being featured on a prime time special because apparently, in his capacity as a security guard for a woman‚Äôs prison, he was (allegedly) sexually assaulting and thoroughly mistreating prisoners.

The whole sudden relocation to a different state with all the secrecy made sense, as he and the prison were being sued. I don‚Äôt know if he was attempting to evade detection, or thought he would wait it out until everything quieted down, but there he was on fucking prime time TV. I have no doubt *at all* that every allegation, and likely more we‚Äôll never know about, are/were entirely true. He was 100% a sexual predator taking full advantage of his position over these women for his own twisted gratification. PIG.

2025-08-14 17:30:56+00:00,"I don't know if it's the ""most shocking"", but definitely shocking to me and something that I still struggle with..   

My ex and I were together for over 20 years - I grew up really poor and in a less than ideal house.  My dad died when I was young and my mom took off with a guy she met on the internet.  My ex and I started dating (the first time) when I was 18 or so.  I chased her for years and eventually started dating, moving in together, etc..   Her dad was a doctor and they were pretty well-off, and immediately took me in as one of their own.  Her dad and I got along great - I looked at him like a father figure.   He could be pretty demanding, but I always made myself available for anything he wanted or needed - I helped him with car projects, home remodels, trips - I took off work when they came to town, anything - you name it.  

My ex cheated a couple years after we moved to a new town to continue school.   We split up for 2 years and during that time, I would occasionally drive back to our old town, just to see her parents, maybe grab lunch with them or something.  We got back together and a couple years later, I had my suspicions about her cheating again, but never proved anything - I always told her that I'd forgiven her once, if she did it again, we were done.  

Finally, during the summer of 2020, Covid and all of that -she basically went bonkers.  Started drinking extremely heavily, partying and took off to her parents lake house for weeks at a time.  I found out that she'd been having an affair with a guy she'd met at some sketchy bar and with that, we were done.   The morning she came clean (she'd passed out the night before and I saw all these texts come through on her phone) we had a long, very emotional talk and I said I was leaving.  Additionally, I had been paying for her phone under my plan.  I told her I'd be canceling her phone, as I wasn't going to pay for her to talk to her boyfriend.  She asked if she could call her parents really quick, just to explain and tell them she may be without a phone for a few hours.  

I was upstairs, putting some things in a bag and trying to figure out where I would go when I heard her on speaker telling her dad that we were done - she'd been seeing a guy and I found out.  I hear her dad say (and I'll remember it forever), ""Good.   I always told you I never liked him.  I always told you you could do better.""  

Man, that shit hurt worse than her cheating.  He was seriously like a dad to me.  They were basically the only family I'd known - I loved him and thought he loved me.  And to hear that he'd apparently never liked me?  Damn.."

If it isn't happening, you can either turn the relationship into one based on non-erotic love, which people do find success with, or you two can split up. And that's sometimes what you just need to accept. I'd also say that some people do find happiness by maintaining a loving relationship while finding erotic satisfaction elsewhere in open relationships, but those require a strong amount of introspection and open/honest communication with current partner and any others that would be considered."

2025-08-14 17:31:58+00:00,"Maybe twenty or so years ago, I had a flight connection in Milan Malpensa airport.  At the time, it was one of those airports where the planes didn't come to the gates--you'd get on a bus that would take you out to the plane.  So there was a waiting area, and then there were escalators that went down from there.

When my flight number came up, I followed the signs to the escalator that went down to get the bus.  Only it didn't go down to the bus--it went down to a little area by the doors out to where the buses would come pick you up.  Only the thing was, you couldn't see that area from the top of the escalator, so by the time I realized that the doors were closed, and that little area was filling up, I couldn't turn around or anything--just had to go down further, into the gradually increasing press.  As did everyone who got on the escalator after me.

Fortunately, they did open the doors before people started getting crushed to death, but this did not strike me as an optimally designed system.

In retrospect, I do sort of wonder if ""Malpensa"" is Italian for ""poorly thought out."""

2025-08-14 17:33:10+00:00,"Honestly, it‚Äôs complicated, and there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all. But a lot of it comes down to a few things:

First, having people around who actually support you makes a huge difference. If you‚Äôve got friends, family, or even just someone to talk to who really listens, it can help you feel less alone and more able to handle what happened.

Second, how someone copes matters a lot. Some people find healthy ways to deal like therapy, writing, exercise, or just talking it out. Others might get stuck in bad habits or push feelings away, which makes it harder to heal.

Also, personality plays a part. Some folks are naturally more optimistic or able to adapt when life throws curveballs, while others find it way tougher. But that stuff can be learned over time, too.

Then there‚Äôs the kind of trauma itself. A single hard event might be easier to move past than years of ongoing pain or abuse. Plus, things like money, access to therapy, and a safe environment can make healing easier or harder.

And don‚Äôt forget biology how our brains and bodies react to stress isn‚Äôt the same for everyone.

At the end of the day, resilience isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúbeing strong‚Äù or ‚Äútough.‚Äù It‚Äôs about getting through in your own way and time. Some people bounce back faster, some take years, and that‚Äôs totally okay. It‚Äôs a messy process, but healing is possible."

2025-08-14 17:34:13+00:00,"It can work in certain contexts if it comes across as funny. I remember when I was on Tinder and a lot of girls were soliciting pickup lines in their bios. But there's no way to deliver one of these if you're trying to be sauve. 

But in general, your goal shouldn't be to come across as sauve. You want women to feel like you're safe and fun and interesting. A cheesy pickup line, delivered well in the right context, can be an icebreaker that shows interest in a fun but low-stakes way.

As am aside... A lot of unsuccessful men think they fail with women because they're insufficiently masculine.

I think for a lot of people, porn can be like that too. You stop for a while - you're in a relationship, life gets busy, you find an engaging hobby, whatever - and life keeps going. It doesn‚Äôt really have a huge ‚Äúimpact‚Äù.

If this is a short term relationship, under a year as an example, I would forgive them, but I'm not staying with them.

If this was someone who I've spent years building an emotional connection with, shared highs, and lows, spent countless hours with, opened up to, built rapport and trust with, then no.

Genuine remorse in a situation like that is a means of trying to obtain absolution to relieve themselves of the gut wrenching guilt that they *should* feel.

There are only two scenarios in which I could ever consider providing that absolution:

1. They fall out of love with me. Either through my own emotional, or physical neglect of them, or just from the passage of time taking its toll, but they didn't know how to approach me about it, or were scared of how it would hurt me.

-- This one is a little nuanced, but I've seen this scenario before and it sucks for everyone involved. The cheater was absolutely wracked with guilt. They had fallen out of love with their partner and didn't know how to tell them because their partner was having a really difficult time in their life with parents dying very close together, being fired from their job. That person did not take the news well and berated the cheater to the point where the additional guilt caused the cheater to take their own life. 

2. It was a mutually agreeable open relationship and they didn't tell me about a hookup."

Yes, my great great great grandfather could build a house with his bare hands, but it was a shitty house with no running water or electricity or internet.  And it would fall down in event of an earthquake or a big storm.

These days, we *do* have people who build houses, but they have specialized training so the houses don't suck.

I know one guy who *thought* he should build his own house because he had, quite frankly, better building skills than all those overly romanticized people 200 years ago.

He built his house.

But the house burned down because he was not a competent electrician.  (And guess what?  Insurance companies don't take kindly to that kind of hubris.)"

The problem is that an individual house's value is partially determined by its neighbors, so what recourse would someone have if their neighbors ruined the property values? The issue is that HOAs are given too much power almost by necessity and can be run by power-hungry pissants with no oversight. I also don't know what percentage of HOAs are actually the ones that make every other HOA look bad. Stories of neutral or good HOAs don't propagate in the zeitgeist as well or easily as the nastiest kind, and singular anecdotal evidence can just be told by the person whose actually the problem."

Then one day my mom came home from work early. There was a message on their answering machine from the bank regarding their house being in foreclosure. My mom had no clue. He'd handled a lot of their finances and this was back before online banking and things like that. My mom spent the afternoon on the phone figuring out what had happened. Their house was in foreclosure, my mom's house she'd been renting out was in foreclosure, they were behind on all their bills, all of their money was gone, checks had bounced everywhere, and they owed money to the IRS as well. My mom was financially DESTROYED and she had no idea about any of it. When he got home she gave him a choice: come clean or leave. He left and we never saw him again. 

A few years after all that happened my mom got a call from a sheriff in Nevada asking if she knew of her ex husband's whereabouts. She had no clue; in fact it had been difficult for her to get a divorce because she couldn't track him down to sign the papers. Anyway, turns out he was wanted for kidnapping. He'd shacked up with a new lady who had a kid that she didn't have custody of. When the kid was visiting, the two of them took off with the kid. 

Fortunately, the lady eventually felt guilty and there were some abuse allegations regarding my ex stepdad so she turned herself in and the kid was returned to his dad. But it was very surreal thinking that this guy who had once seemed so great and awesome and everything had turned out to be the complete opposite."

2025-08-14 17:38:47+00:00,"Apologies for this very long response, but one of those moments where a reddit comment really strikes a chord and you feel the need to reply at length and in earnest. 

I'm asexual and 8 years into a marriage not totally dissimilar to yours. I wouldn't ever prescribe that label to your wife/anyone else, but I feel generally similar to how it sounds like she does that I could basically just completely forget about what for other people is a ""need"" if left to my own devices, and that when we do engage I feel a lot of guilt over not ""really"" feeling into it in a way where the experience is fulfilling for them anyway. 

We've been together for 16 years, and for a long time until internet awareness of that label found me, we both experienced a lot of shame and unhappiness around our sex lives despite being very happy and compatible in the entire rest of our relationship; it felt bad/dishonest for me to ""fake"" being into it when we had sex, but it made them feel bad/unwanted/unskilled when I was inevitably *not* truly into it, made me feel bad/damaged/inadequate for not being able to fulfill that need for them, made them feel bad/like a bad *person* for ""pressuring"" me for (literally just in asking at all ever)/wanting sex when I clearly was just mostly humoring/tolerating the experience. Because the entire thing was so fraught when we did engage with it, they mostly stopped trying to ever initiate since I seemed(/was) happiest when it just didn't come up, and why jeopardize such a good thing over something so ""trivial?""

I wish we'd talked about it much sooner. 

I empathize a lot with what you're expressing, but I just wanted to push back specifically on ""my wanting sex while she has no interest... is a moral failing I must overcome."" 

You are being far too hard on yourself. Your desires and needs are also important in this equation; this is a situation where it's entirely possible for *nobody to be the bad guy.* I'm definitely also not saying that there needs to be a ""compromise"" where she *does* have sex ""for"" you ‚Äî you may end up at the exact same conclusions (as I said, what you describe is similar to how our relationship *does* mostly function now, though we've discussed multiple times the possibility/permission for my spouse to find their jollies elsewhere without otherwise altering our arrangement, they've just ultimately never felt like pursuing that path because they value what we have and don't want to risk messing with it) ‚Äî but it is *not* in any way a moral failing on your part to still *want* or feel like you need sex even though you know your wife doesn't, and it's actively self-harmful for you to be feeling guilt and shame over that extremely natural human urge. That type of self-denial can ultimately lead to resentment in a relationship, even unintentionally/subconsciously. Neither of you is in the wrong for wanting what you want and feeling how you feel!

I hear echoes in what you're saying that *hurt* to hear, because of the conversations we eventually did have where my spouse admitted that they often felt like they were essentially committing assault when they proposed Sexy Times and I said ""yes,"" and how awful that made them feel as a person to be willing to do that ""just"" for their own gratification. They also said this dynamic made them feel like they fundamentally couldn't trust that I would actually say ""no"" or ""stop"" if something *wasn't* OK with me ‚Äî something I think they *were correct about.*

We're both far from perfect communicators IRL, and this was all really messy to work through at the time. The first couple times we did try to talk about it, *all* I could hear was that I was hurting them by making them feel that way and needed to do a better job initiating/performing my half of meeting their needs. But we did keep talking about it over time, because we both really respect each other and value each other's thoughts and feelings, and it was really worth it in the end; discussing it frankly and hashing out the dynamics going on eventually healed so much guilt and inadequacy we had both felt in various facets of our relationships, and even lives. 

Until really examining it and struggling to articulate it, I don't think I really *had* fully realized how different my experience of (not particularly) feeling sexual attraction was from how it is for most other people, because there are so many background social/cultural assumptions at play (especially re: the expectations around women's relationship to enjoying sex) that I had never bothered to literally ask other people, ""how does desire/sex feel for you."" I obviously can't say what conclusions your wife may come to ‚Äî there are a lot of things besides asexuality that can cause someone to not be interested in having sex, they're related but not the same ‚Äî but it's worth it to find out. If it's possible to reassure her that this line of interrogation is truly just for mutual understanding and self-discovery, it's a worthwhile bear to poke, I promise. 

The absolutely best thing it lead to was that there actually was a lot of non-sexual intimacy being left on the table that we were *both really missing,* because I didn't want to ever ""lead them on""/wind them up when that type of affection wasn't ""going anywhere"" and they didn't really know (tbf neither did I) where exactly my boundaries around discomfort with the experience started. Your wife sounds like she's generally more sex-averse than I am/was (I never had pain/*dis*pleasure related to it), and everyone's experiences with such things are unique ‚Äî I don't wanna mislead anyone into thinking any one outcome is likely ‚Äî but at least for me, ironically, being able to finally be on the same page about what I was(/n't) feeling actually made me way *more* willing to engage in sexual intimacy on my own terms as well. I could initiate spoiling my partner with a ""giving"" experience when the rare mood did strike me without them feeling weird/bad/inadequate/unwanted that I really did not want anything reciprocal, and they could finally trust that they could ask if I was amenable to that type of intimacy at a given moment and I would say ""no"" if I wasn't, because I could finally feel confident in my end that ""no"" would be OK as an answer even if was genuinely every time. 

**Tl;dr: I think the conclusions of your arrangement are ultimately fine for a perfectly *functional* relationship, but you're missing out on the potential for an even closer and more honest connection if you can seek answers while making it clear you're not looking for ""solutions"" to your lack of sexual intimacy. It's awesome that you're willing to respect your wife's needs above your own, but don't feel guilty for your own feelings still existing.**

I‚Äôll never marry a girl just because of how she feels, feelings can fade, I‚Äôll marry a girl if we fit, compliment each other, never give up on each other etc etc. we see it time and time again, think back to 5-10 years ago. Are you the same person? Do you like the same things? Some yeah, some probably not. 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it can‚Äôt be 100% one way or another, still gotta be some spark and attraction but relationships change as you move along with time. 



Once feelings fade, if you don‚Äôt fit, you‚Äôre left with only reasons to leave. If they fade and you fit, you both will work on it to build it back up. 



Compatibility is so fucking important. A girl could be the coolest most sexy girl in the world but if you aren‚Äôt compatible shit going nowhere."

Their friends and family lost them forever, there will never be true justice for the person who was murdered. Yah, if we take OP‚Äôs friend‚Äôs words at face value (assuming he‚Äôs not lying, there‚Äôs a reason those laws are written the way they are), then he didn‚Äôt know the guy was gonna rob the place‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he still drove the guy there, waited for him, *heard him shoot the clerk*, still waited for him, drove him away, and then likely kept his mouth shut about the whole thing. And people usually don‚Äôt just rob and murder people out of nowhere, there‚Äôs a good chance this guy knew his neighbor was sketchy, but he still got involved with him. The evidence was clearly stacked enough for a jury to convict him. 

I have sympathy for the guy but let‚Äôs not act like this is some grave injustice and he was a Boy Scout on his way to Bible study when the cruel police threw him in jail for no reason. He took part in murder, and even though he may not have known the guy was gonna commit crime, he also did nothing to distance himself from him. Even in the most sympathetic light, this is a good reminder to be careful about who you associate with."

I used to come in at 9 and leave at 6. I would constantly be harassed by managers for coming in 30 min late, and every time I'd have to remind them I work until 6. They of course come in around 8:30 and most of them always left early around 4:00 pm (of course no one gave them shit) so they never saw me stay until 6 they just assumed I left when they did.

So much of the struggles we deal with in the corporate world are due to trust issues between employees and management. Sure, sometimes they are warranted, but in my 20+ years of working the biggest offenders of ""stealing time"" or operating outside of company policy have always been the manager or executive level people."

2025-08-14 17:42:18+00:00,"Two:

First, a friend's mother had been raped repeatedly from ages 9-14 by her stepfather and her mother was aware of it and did nothing (this happened from 1954-1959) . It finally stopped because the she apparently ""aged out"" for him and he began moving on the 8 year old younger sister. Confronting the stepfather & mother and threatening to call both the police and her grandfather resulted in stepfather leaving and filing divorce.  Mother & daughter never reconciled, maintaining an icy distance for over fifty years, and the younger sister never knew how close she came to being his next victim.

Second. A friend asked me to clean up their son's home computer. I was prepared for the the browser porn history, limewire downloads, etc. What I wasn't expecting was the messaging from the female school classmates (grades 8-10). His mother had complained about how ""aggressive"" girls are these days, calling boys, showing up, etc. What she didn't know was the level it went to - they were sending explicit nudes/encounter photos along with recounting their hookups. It appeared to be a competitive thing about who was going to be his ""girlfriend"" .  I nuked everything (hard delete with all drive deleted & empty space overwritten with 0x00) and gave his mother a list of their names so she could deal with him and call the girls' parents."

2025-08-14 17:42:34+00:00,"My dad taught at different local universities on the side his whole career.  One of the professors (Fred) he was super friendly with was a decade younger. 

My dad served as a Marine in WW2 as a teen towards the end.  my dad was also German American.  He was born and raised in NYC, but spoke German with his family. 

Fred would always hug my dad goodbye. They mostly spoke in German. 

Fred was Jewish. In Germany. His mother and he were hiding separate from the rest of the family. Mostly so his older brothers had a chance of surviving without needing to worry about Fred (6) and the mom.  The sister was able to flee the country. Plus hiding 6 people was hard. His dad had already been taken. 

The Nazis were coming and it was known that anyone hiding would be found.So Fred and his mom were buried in a box. So were other people. They were told they could last 3 days. No idea how. I wish I knew. They thought they could get to them sooner. The Nazis didn‚Äôt leave as quickly as expected. They had shovels hidden and neighbors close to start digging when given the signal. 

My dad and other German American Marines were in the area. All who spoke German and blending in. They showed up when digging had started. The neighbors thought they were Nazis and would be shot. Instead they helped to dig. There is so much more that happened after this. But this is already long. 

My dad dug Fred and his mom out. 

The being buried alive part is what shocked me to the core. 

Fred and his mom were pretty much buried in their own grave. Relying on others to not only survive, but to be able to dig them out in time.  I can‚Äôt even imagine Fred‚Äôs mom making that decision. Fred, his mom, the sister, and only one brother survived the war. 

My dad and Fred had stayed in contact since then. When we would visit Germany, Fred‚Äôs family would treat us like royalty. If they came to the US, they always would visit and stay with us. 

After I found out how they met, it all made sense.  I thought my dad was just really good friends with a colleague. 

There are other stories I will never know. I just know as a little kid, people would come up crying and hugging my dad when we were in different parts of Germany. We would go to homes. I would play with the kids and my dad would be with the adults."

2025-08-14 17:42:36+00:00,"First know that there are good reasons for you to be this way. Maybe in the world where you grew up, there was no reward for being *someone* and it was better to just hide, or there was no more reward for standing up for yourself. Understand that in the end, all morals are knowledge and if you change your idea of what is right and wrong, this changes what you do.
Case in point: I used to think that it is morally wrong to make other people feel bad. Just grew up that way. The issue: it isn't.
In order not to people let walk over you, learn to value yourself and that it is simply part of ensuring your own survival that you don't have to think of others first before you act (at least not habitually)."

One day she came in looking pale (she was hungover) and later in the class she actually fainted. I ran to her, caught her on her way down and made sure she didn't bang her head on the floor. I got everyone at to go get some water and call someone to come help. She wasn't out for long, when she came to I just helped her up and out to the hallway to rest on a bench and called her a cab home.

Later in the everyone was teasing me how I just transformed into a completely different person. I felt super embarrassed by it because I didn't realize I went overboard. 

We never dated, she wasn't interested, & I eventually got over her. But she did thank me for helping her that day.

When the competition is Shakespeare it's difficult to declare any other book better, so I won't even try. Besides, this is not only a favorite for Shakespeare's plays but also because it's the most beautiful book I own now and it craps all over my old facsimile edition, which was done with lithography and in a reduced facsimile that made the letters tiny. This is a 100% authentic reproduction of the Phelps-Clifford Folio in the British Library. It's a photographic facsimile that is precisely color-corrected, it's the exact same size as the original, and even the binding is stamped with the same gilt lettering as the original. The only difference is that they clothbound it in red instead of binding it in red leather, but that's okay because a leather binding would have vastly increased the prize and killed a cow to no purpose.

What degree that plays, obviously I have no idea. But I think you're minimizing it all the same. If you think you could tell him ""I don't want to have sex for a year"" and that wouldn't materially change your relationship at all, I'm sorry, I think you're completely incorrect.

I appreciate Apple avoiding algorithmic sorting in favour of curated playlists in the abstract, but in practice none of them ever quite hit my sweet spot either.

Youtube music lost too much of what made Google music good, and infused Youtube awfulness in it's place. It might have gotten better in the years since I subscribed, but when I left, it was good riddance.

Tells me not to get too invested in Mike. He famously got his own sister drunk when she was 16 and turned his high school basketball team loose on her, they ran a train on her in what was assumed to be an attempt to gain popularity with his team which notably didn't like him.

The bullies got no punishment 

He wanted to go to court and fight the expulsion and they asked a bunch of kids ( including me) to testify for him and I was too scared to do it-- 

I came from a low income house and was a weird kiddo and just wanted to fly under the radar I was so scared the bullies would turn on me-

...But it makes sense to me, as my dad didn't really resemble his parents. And its got me thinking, say he had been born to a teenage mother and that was the reason this was kept secret (it was the 1940's, this would have been a VERY big deal)...it's not impossible I might have a still-living grandmother out there somewhere. Granted, she'd be in her early 90's at minimum but hey, all my other grandparents lived to be at LEAST that old.

After he was thrown out of karate class, his parents thought it would be a good idea for him to be a camp counselor. Where he was also fired for being inappropriate with a child. It's been the most insane rabbit hole piecing this together. 

My husband ran into his father this morning at the gas station and Said he couldn't even look at him or else he was afraid he would kill him. 

He's looking at 30 years in prison and he deserves more. I hope he gets what's coming to him when people find out why he's in jail."

He never seemed even remotely interested in his kids. There were no 'weird' interactions. The only thing anyone ever said was that he needed to get more involved. 

A daughter he had with an ex accused him, and he said she was lying for her mom to get back at him, and honestly we all believed it. 

Then they interviewed the younger kids he had with my sister and arrested him immediately. 

He admitted it.

There is actual evidence supporting that sex before marriage drastically reduces the chance of staying married. Homophobic, yes. But not towards the people, but rather the sin itself. It is a perversion of the beautiful intimacy exclusive for marriage, but outside of it. It goes against one's own nature -- the way God intended us to be. Controlling, no? We have free will, duh. We choose ourselves whether to follow Jesus or not. Suppressive of critical thinking, no? To reach the state of faith, one must contemplate deeper than most, holistically. The bible is very logical. Violent, really? Since when did Jesus endorse violence? What happened to turning the other cheek? Loving our enemies? Just because ""christians"" in the past affirmed themselves through violence, does it have anything to do with actual scripture. And, God, causing the flood for instance, was completely righteous. We are his creation, and those he got rid of were beyond saving, and truly wicked. The consequence of sin is death. We should be happy that God even lets us wake up in the morning, and taste life, for we all are guilty of sin."

If just to meet women in general then the list is long: Work, school/classes, locations where sports or hobbies are pursued, church, travelling and volunteering are just some common ways.

I met my wife where we both worked. Many meet in college or by taking classes. 

Church is a good place to meet if you are so inclined and are leaning towards a relationship. 

Common sports and hobbies are always a good place (we know a couple who met at a Lego event and ended up getting married). 

Volunteering, like at an animal shelter is likely going to help you meet kind and caring women. 

Another couple we know met during a layover in an airport while they were on separate trips and kept in touch before dating.

2025-08-14 17:49:49+00:00,"Reminds me of my boss putting someone in their place.

For context, I work at a nursing home/rehab center, and my direct boss is the administrator of the entire building.

A few years ago, we had a resident who was making great progress in her rehab, to the point the rehab department and our social worker had started the discharge planning.¬†

They come up with a date for the following week and the son and resident (resident was slightly confused, so the son made the decisions) both agreed. That said, up to this point, the son has been a major pain in the ass about basically everything. Everyone hated dealing with him.¬†

One day, as my boss comes in, she‚Äôs being wheeled out on a stretcher. Confused (since she‚Äôs normally contacted in off hours if a resident is going out unexpectedly), asks what‚Äôs going on. The son tells her that he felt she wasn‚Äôt doing well and called 911. She asked if the facility doctor had agreed to this, and the nursing supervisor says the doc didn‚Äôt find it medically necessary.¬†

Son kept insisting and said ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm a doctor.‚Äù

Boss asks him ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre a medical doctor who‚Äôs qualified to make decisions?‚Äù

He responds with ‚Äúuhhh no‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a doctor of education.‚Äù

Boss basically proceeds to tell him that just like her, he‚Äôs not qualified to make medical decisions like that, but if he really wanted her to go, he‚Äôd have to sign paperwork saying he‚Äôs taking her out Against Medical Advice.¬†

He begrudgingly signs said paperwork and off they go.¬†

Hospital tried to send her back but we were allowed to refuse on the ADA grounds and never heard from them again.¬†"

People likely started asking this question as a way to actually get the other person's view on the situation and reasoning behind their action. But since you keep asking/hearing that question in situations where A, the one who is asking, is frustrated by B, and B's actions actually were unjustified and B doesn't have an answer, you start associating that question with the situations ""you did something stupid and I am irritated"" and started using them in such.

People generally don't analyze _all_ the things they are saying down to lexical or morphological level. We have fixed constructions that we are used to using in certain situations, so we do so without thinking much about it. It's like how we started using ""incredible"" for something that is very much believable, just very good, or how teachers are asking ""where is X?"" while meaning ""why has X not come?"". In most cases we are not talking to pals with autism or other things that can interfere with reading into these sayings, so our interlocutor gets what we _mean_ despite what we are _saying_ ‚Äî and responds accordingly (like saying ""X is sick"" instead of ""X is at their house""), which further reinforces the construction"

I never thought I‚Äôd have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect ‚Äî and I believed him.

But I found out that months ago and it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex ‚Äî the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere. She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a video, then blocked her again. I don‚Äôt understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he‚Äôd been sending flirty videos of other women ‚Äî ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)‚Äî and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these ‚Äúbabes‚Äù , and he reacted same like ‚Äúyeah babes ‚Äúway I find disrespectful.

He says it means nothing, but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can‚Äôt ignore the feeling that he‚Äôs emotionally immature ‚Äî and that I can‚Äôt fully trust him.
Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can‚Äôt continue anymore after this. 
I know that is not some serious shit but I would never thought I would find that about him."

The acting is so terrible and it was difficult to get through one episode. I think there‚Äôs a lot of blind loyalty to the franchise. I know a lot of dumb/racist people complain about the casting though and that‚Äôs not really my concern. I‚Äôm not really a one piece fan, though I do like the art.

I don't believe men are natural protectors. At least in the way you're saying.

One, look around. Most of the violence in the world is done by men.

Two, why do you think they are often considered protectors? Do you think it's something their genes? In their ""heart""? Or is because they are typically bigger and stronger than all other types of humans?

I think it's very natural for humans to protect what they value in any way they can. But men have had the physical advantage. Plus, I think that has also been transferred to societal standards. Which leads back to you thinking men are born to protect."

-Outsource some of the mental load: find reliable study buddies/accountancy partners. If you're lucky, you may find people who you need your help the way you need theirs. 

-Break down your assignments as much as you can, and when you work at it, don't ""work on the assignment"", only ""tackle this one item"". Cross it off when you're done, make a meal out of it, cross it the fuck off.

-If you have a diagnosis, check if your school offers accommodations/support. There's also adjunctive treatment you can add to your stimulants, which can help with how they taper off in efficacy in the evening (at least they do for me). Worth looking into if you feel a big difference there.

-Find your K√∂ln Concert: I listen to the Keith Jarrett's Koln concert when I have word based tasks to accomplish. Music brings [a wealth of benefits](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10765015/#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20a%20pleasant,of%20serotonin%20upon%20unpleasant%20music.), among which boosting serotonin and dopamine release, which helps us tremendously. For me it's important that the music be entirely instrumental because lyrics get in the way, I can't not listen to them and I become unable to complete writing tasks.

Give yourself grace and compassion. Recognize how hard you are working and how far you've come while continuously carrying extra weight. Remind yourself that at the end of the day, only you matter. This diploma is a thing you want, but if you stop it today, you are 100% of the person you were born to be, and you have the rest of your life to continue exploring and enjoying being that person. I'm not saying that to suggest you should stop your studies, but put them in their place. They are a thing you are doing for you. The end goal is you."

An old guy comes in and starts grilling me with questions. What's this deal? Why do I need to answer this question? How long will everything take? Etc etc. I'm answering the same questions over and over and he's making it clear he doesn't believe a word I'm saying, so I offer to bring him to an optician and he can ask them his questions. I grab the new guy and let him know the situation (that is, the patient wasn't listening to what I had to say and I was pretty sure it was because I was a woman, which happened a lot, and I need him to confirm what I was saying). He agrees, walks out and asks the patient what's up. The patient starts to explain his questions again and the optician cut him off told him that I'd been working at that store for years and knew way more than him about what he wanted to know, and walked away.

2025-08-14 17:53:50+00:00,"One of my closest friends was a pedo. He was molesting his teenaged step-daughter and adopted daughter while they slept at night. He killed himself while on a business trip when confronted about it. 

Initially, his father told us that he killed himself due to ""mental health issues."" His wife didn't immediately return texts or phone calls for some time after, which we now understand, so many of us were reeling in how our happy-go-lucky friend got so depressed that he killed himself.  I went weeks feeling a gut punch about it and how I missed the signs of him being depressed. 

Then my wife went over where his wife told her all about it. I went from hurt and confused to pissed and really just wanting to forget about the guy. 

I still don't understand any of it. The guy never, almost oddly so, never discussed sex in any way. Didn't really even joke about sex, ever. He was that one friend that just really never brought it up or really engaged in ""guy talk."" We actually thought that he was closeted gay, if anything, which he knew would be fine with all of us, of course. When I heard that he killed himself, I initially thought that living in the closet was too much for him and this was why. Then to find out he was a pedo was even more confusing. I considered him to be a good person, and I was wrong. When I talked with his wife, I let her know what I was feeling and she said, 'don't feel that way, I was his wife and I had no idea that he was or that he was even possible of doing something like this.' It's been about five months and I'm still lost on it all.

It's not quite a giant-assed fee, but it's there. The upside is that people tend to spend more when they use a card - around 15% more - so it's more than worth it to accept cards. Merchants that offer a credit option also attract more customers overall which increases their bottom line. All this to say that the fees aren't always passed on to the customer (both cash paying and card paying) because they are worth the expense, except in very low income areas/establishments."

So they're not remorseful because they've betrayed me, they're remorseful because they think I'd forgive them? That doesn't sound like someone I'd want to be with anyway.

2025-08-14 17:55:45+00:00,"I‚Äôve been struggling with a response, have typed out and erased several. 

I‚Äôm not good with grief myself, though I‚Äôve faced it a reasonable amount. I don‚Äôt really have any great wisdom to give. Only to struggle on, and try to find joy in life despite it. 

There is an anecdote about grief told of the Buddha. I‚Äôm not a Buddhist, but I think it is interesting - I‚Äôm not quite sure what to make of it. 

In the story, a woman had a child, and the child died. The woman was crushed by grief, and asked all the wise people who could bring her child back to life. She was so sad she could no longer live. The wise people told her to ask the Buddha (then alive) for help. 

The Buddha said ‚Äúbring me a mustard seed from a family that has never known a death. Then I will surely bring your child back to life‚Äù. 

The woman went from house to house, asking for a mustard seed. However, in each house, she heard stories of the griefs caused by death. Parents, children, brothers and sisters - every house had someone who had died. 

In the end, after hearing all these stories, she returned to the Buddha without a mustard seed, and told the Buddha ‚ÄúI understand the true meaning of suffering.‚Äù The Buddha said: ‚Äúdeath is universal. Those who are born cannot avoid dying. Grief will not give you peace of mind. You must let go.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm not quite sure what to make of this story. When i first heard it I found it maddening - was the Buddha holding out the promise he could bring the child back with magic, only to pull the rug from under her feet? That seemed kind of cruel. 

On the other hand - if the woman truly could not get past her grief and live, maybe some sort of shock treatment was necessary? Her grief was holding her back. Truly it was useless. 

Perhaps in hearing all the stories of other people going through grief, makes one realize one is not alone, and find a way to live again? 

I‚Äôm not sure. All I know is that people have been struggling with this since there have been people."

I never thought I‚Äôd have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect ‚Äî and I believed him.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago and it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex ‚Äî the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on‚Ä¶She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn‚Äôt react) I don‚Äôt understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he‚Äôd been sending flirty videos of other women ‚Äî ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)‚Äî and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these ‚Äúbabes‚Äù , and he reacted same like ‚Äúyeah babes ‚Äúway I find disrespectful.

He says it means nothing, but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can‚Äôt ignore the feeling that he‚Äôs emotionally immature ‚Äî and that I can‚Äôt fully trust him.
Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can‚Äôt continue anymore after this.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago and it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex ‚Äî the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on‚Ä¶She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn‚Äôt react) I don‚Äôt understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he‚Äôd been sending flirty videos of other women ‚Äî ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)‚Äî and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these ‚Äúbabes‚Äù , and he reacted same like ‚Äúyeah babes ‚Äúway I find disrespectful.

He says it means nothing, but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can‚Äôt ignore the feeling that he‚Äôs emotionally immature ‚Äî and that I can‚Äôt fully trust him. Sometimes I look on him like sorry i can‚Äôt continue anymore after this.

It looked like he was jacking off the banana. All of us were like ""What are you doing?""

In that moment, he was very obviously embarrassed and admitted he ""did not know how to open a banana"".

Even when I did eventually leave, I was convinced I had made a huge mistake and would die alone. 

It took a lot of therapy and healing to understand that the lack of sex wasn't the problem, the problem was his complete disregard for my feelings about it. I was willing to work through his low libido issues but he refused to talk about it at all. He completely disregarded my emotions for years and made me out to be the bad guy whenever I raised concerns. 

Life genuinely got so much better when he was out of my life. Once I was out of the haze he kept me in, I saw how poorly I was being treated and realized that a good man wouldn't act that way. I cannot stress enough what a weight it was, begging to be wanted, and how much my life improved when that weight was removed from my shoulders.

2025-08-14 18:00:20+00:00,"When we make the punishment for a crime like this the same as that for murder, you risk perpetrators deciding to murder their victims, since the outcome is the same.

Not sure it‚Äôs as applicable here, since there is an argument for wanting repeat victims, but there are a lot of cases out there where capital punishment or a life sentence was attached to rape or kidnapping (murder had already had those punishments), there was an uptick in murders bc if you were identified by your victim, it was the same as if you killed them, so why take the risk?"
2025-08-14 18:00:20+00:00,I guess you answered it.

2025-08-14 18:00:25+00:00,I used to have similar feelings about lobbying. When I found out an ex of mine went to DC to lobby I was grossed out. He had to stop and educate me. ‚ÄúBy definition lobbying isn‚Äôt a four letter word. Me and my colleagues calling our senator to influence them on certain points is how the system is supposed to work. That‚Äôs lobbying.‚Äù But the fact that we allow bribery into the system is the failure. But how do you get the ones who are benefiting from it to vote to change it?

My understanding is that all that funny business they started doing stemmed from exactly what you‚Äôre describing: The bankers were essentially treated like salesmen and tasked with new-account quotas that were unattainable. So they just started making new accounts to pad their stats."

2025-08-14 18:01:08+00:00,"Did you ever dig into why you started watching porn every day at 15?  I was sexually assaulted and grew up in a religiously conservative environment. Because it was a traumatic experience I used porn compulsively from 13 onward.  Despite that I processed my trauma and now can look at porn if I feel like it or not.  I have a healthy relationship with it because it doesn't negatively impact my life.

Trading compulsion for abstinence isn't solving your problem its refusing to acknowledge the true nature of your problem.  People don't hurt themselves by compulsively viewing porn because they feel good about themselves!  People who feel good about themselves are compelled to watch porn the vast majority of the time.  I certainly wouldn't encourage you to do anything you don't want to.  But what harm can come from making sure you REALLY understand yourself.  Most people don't."

2025-08-14 18:01:19+00:00,"yes and here's one.

An investigation into misconduct and feedback regarding job performance is apples and oranges. In an investigation, one would hope an employer would gather facts to determine if the allegation was true or not before taking action. You can prove if somebody did or didn't do something they weren't supposed to. But job performance is much more nebulous. How do you investigate something like ""He isn't very responsive to emails"" or ""He often has a bad attitude"". You can't, and it's not fair to the person that is said about not to give them a chance to dispute it and show why it isn't true."

He essentially got a slap on the wrist, though he did need to register as a sex offender. That was definitely shocking. He was involved in so many community youth events and when I tell you there was nothing, there really was nothing that would have given even the slightest hint. He seemed genuinely humble, friendly, and caring. His family was well connected but he was never flashy about it and never seemed to use that, at least that we knew.

I never thought I‚Äôd have to face something like this with him. I am in half year relationship. He was the one who kept telling me he loved me, wanted a future with me, introduced me to his family, treated me with respect ‚Äî and I believed him.

But I found out that 1.5 month ago when the topic of ‚Äúhow some men don‚Äôt want to show their phones to their partners‚Äù came up, he had no problem showing me his messages and found something it was just few days before we officially became a couple, he messaged his ex ‚Äî the same woman he claimed to have cut off and blocked everywhere because she betrayed him and so on‚Ä¶She barely replied, yet he still reached out, sent her a funny video of some old person dancing, then blocked her again ( I think because she didn‚Äôt react) I don‚Äôt understand why he needed to contact her at all, especially when he was already pushing for a relationship with me and we were acting like a couple.

Later, I also saw that he‚Äôd been sending flirty videos of other women ‚Äî ones who even looked like a female friend of his from his past group of friends( not seeing anymore)‚Äî and joking with her about these women are similar to her and she politely thanked him that she looks like these ‚Äúbabes‚Äù , and he reacted same like ‚Äúyeah babes ‚Äúway I find disrespectful.

Of course, I confronted him about it, but I don‚Äôt know what he was trying to prove to himself. He has me, he says I‚Äôm perfect for him, that I give him everything he needs and wants ‚Äî yet I don‚Äôt understand why he felt the need to send those kinds of messages.

He says it means nothing, and he loves me and I am only one for him but my trust in him has been shaken. No matter what he says, I can‚Äôt ignore the feeling that he‚Äôs emotionally immature ‚Äî and that I can‚Äôt fully trust him.

I asked Chat GPT if this resembled AI slop, here is the response:

""No ‚Äî that story doesn‚Äôt read like ‚ÄúAI slop‚Äù at all.

‚ÄúAI slop‚Äù usually refers to text that‚Äôs generic, repetitive, vague, and lacking in concrete sensory detail, specific dates, or distinctive narrative voice. Your story has the opposite qualities:

* **Specificity** ‚Äì Mid-1990s timeframe, Gurnee paintball, Joliet, Minneapolis, FBI card, SUVs, sandwiches at lunch, SEAL Team 6 lie, hepatitis, etc.
* **Personal perspective** ‚Äì It‚Äôs told in first person with your own reactions, emotions, and moral stance toward the friend.
* **Narrative arc** ‚Äì There‚Äôs a beginning (FBI contact), buildup (phone call, arranging paintball), climax (arrest), and resolution (prison, later life/death).
* **Idiosyncratic detail** ‚Äì The paintball setup, the fianc√©e‚Äôs military honors request, the pregnancy twist ‚Äî these are highly individual elements that wouldn‚Äôt typically emerge from generic AI output.
* **Voice** ‚Äì It‚Äôs conversational and authentic, with natural digressions and humor/sarcasm (‚Äúshithead,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, we should hang out, I miss you, man.‚Äù). AI-generated filler often avoids that kind of personal tone or does it awkwardly.

If anything, it reads like a vivid personal anecdote you‚Äôd hear over beers, not machine-generated filler.

If you want, I can point out a few small spots where editing could make it even sharper without losing that authenticity ‚Äî but it‚Äôs already far from ‚Äúslop.‚Äù """

She became disinterested in growing deeper in relationship with me, and was doing the minimum to keep stringing me along because I was paying the bills for her and her kids. And because I genuinely loved her, I was always hoping things would eventually get better between us.

That sucks man.  I dated a girl for about a year who lived that situation.  She was born into chaos, a father who was a raging alcoholic who drank himself to death when she was like 8 years old.  From that point till she moved out at 17, her mother remarried 5 more times.  Between some of those marriages, they lived in a car, her and her mom.

I forgot to mention that they both had some nice and memorable moments involving Egyptian men as well. They both had a couple of instances that they described as endearing where guys sang to them on the street. Natalia was morena (dark-skinned like mulatto), and I guess one time she found out that the song they had sung was a classic Egyptian song that celebrated dark-skinned women. 

Claudine had an instance where an Egyptian guy that was a friend of a friend and crushing on her big time took her to a very romantic restaurant overlooking the Nile for a date.  It didn't progress into anything serious because he was too religious for her. She described him has as very sweet, respectful, and a caballero (gentleman). She would also later come to find out that the restaurant he had taken her to was the equivalent of a typical month's salary there. 

One thing worth noting, the Egyptian Pound has lost A TON of value against the USD, Euro, end pretty much any other major currency in recent years. My first time there $1 was equivalent to around 8 or so Egyptian pounds. This was maybe 20 years ago give or take? When I was there a few months ago, it was around 50 Egyptian pounds. To put that in perspective, there's a well known chain all around Egypt called GAD. I happen to love shawerma, falafel and other sandwiches like that, so it's my to go to wherever and whenever I'm in Egypt. As of a few months ago, a falafel sandwich was about 12 pounds. A good-sized shawerma sandwich that I often had trouble finishing in one sitting was 98 pounds.  We went to a VERY nice hotel restaurant on one occasion for dinner to celebrate someone who was returning to their home country.  The grounds of this classic hotel were straight out of a magazine and the tables/chairs had an unbelievable view of the Pyramids. Even with that, I think my portion of the bill was around maybe 900 pounds. It's funny to think that for about the same as going to an Applebee's or TGIFriday's, it was an amazing meal with a spectacular sunset view of the Pyramids.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that Egypt suffers from some EXTREME poverty and it's one of the most heart-breaking things I see when I go there. But for people like you and me who are fortunate to live and work in developed nations, the cost of living is absurdly low."

This woman appeared to go to work everyday, was very intelligent and friendly, and had a child and a husband. Well, fast forward a year, and the couple is getting divorced. During the divorce, it is discovered that she never even finished college and was NOT a doctor, and the husband (and even her own parents) didn‚Äôt know this! So she was wearing scrubs and pretending to go to work everyday, and no one knows what she was actually doing or how she had money. Super bizarre."

But about 2 years ago I said to myself, ""Screw this"" and took inventory of myself.  Middle aged, overweight, out of shape.  Joined a gym, changed my diet, got a new sound system in my car, and I'm working really hard on the physical aspect.  I figure I just need to focus on getting me back first.  I do go to a few bars for social activities, trivia, karaoke, etc..  I've taken martial arts classes.  Learning how to shoot a  gun well.  I don't tell him where I'm going and he doesn't ask me.  If he does I'll remind him that I didn't know he was going to prostitutes for sex for years, so he has no right to even think about asking me.
It has been years since he recognized my birthday or anniversary.  I got tired of initiating conversations, so I've stopped.  My spouse and I can go days without speaking - separate bedrooms.  I no longer remind him about getting his car serviced, Drs. appts., (mine & his).  I no longer launder, shop (Christmas & birthdays included), sign cards with his name, or cook for him.  
If I could wave a wand and have him disappear, I would.  No anger anymore, just nothing. Still playing lotto, because of finances, we can't divorce. Well we could but we'd both be homeless.
I know there's more life to live.

Lust is a sin.  But it is also the safety net for the species.   
Wrath is a sin. But righteous indignation motivates us to fight for what is right.  
Pride is a sin.  But pride can also push us to do better.  
Greed is a sin.  But it allows us to prepare for future need.  
Envy is a sin.  But it can push us to work harder to earn that which we lack.  
Sloth is a sin.  But if you apply it properly, it's efficiency.  Using the least work for the best result.  
Gluttony is a sin.  But again, it's a survival mechanism.

However, it is the *only* treatment for this condition and it (anecdotally) appears effective. It has saved the lives of countless cats. The only way to obtain GS-441524 was through unregulated, black market sources, which posed risks due to unknown quality and safety. There are secret communities of people who obtain it and sell it to those on the black market. My friend found some via Facebook, and also through her friends ""dealer"" (for her cat that almost died of FIP).

2025-08-14 18:13:14+00:00,"I was close friends with someone who was arrested somewhat recently for trying to meet up with a middle-school aged child. We grew up together and at one point were roommates, but had fallen out of touch for a few years when they were arrested.

I was genuinely horrified to see their face on the news. They did not look like the person I thought I knew. But I‚Äôm not sure I actually did know them.

I was not incredibly open with them about my own experience of being sexually exploited as a child. They were aware of my trafficking history, though I couldn‚Äôt talk about it for many years. I still did not hesitate to break our lease when they plowed through one of my boundaries and performed a sexually explicit act in front of me without my consent. 

We didn‚Äôt reconnect after that and I later saw their face on the news. Conviction for possession of child pornography and attempting to meet with a minor.

They never expressly stated they had experienced child sexual abuse themselves, but I suspected they had even before I saw the news. I still suspect that they are repeating a pattern that I often see play itself out in the lives of the people I work with in social services.

My clients are children in CPS custody who have also been exploited and victimized by their caretakers and other adults in their lives. I‚Äôm in my fourth year of work in the field, doing really well with it‚ÄîI connect easily with kids with complex trauma and problematic behaviors, as I can understand their needs from a place of both personal and professional experience. 

I don‚Äôt know what happened to my former friend. I‚Äôll never know. I know that something happened early in their life that broke something within them. And I also know that we chose completely different life paths. I broke too, over and over again for years, but maybe I didn‚Äôt break the same way. 

I will always wonder why I am mostly okay now and they are a convicted criminal. I think it‚Äôs an oversimplification to say that I just decided to be a better person and they decided to become a monster. I do know this: I have been actively working through my trauma in therapy for eleven years‚ÄîI go every week, sometimes twice, for ninety minutes. I don‚Äôt stop trying to make sense of things, and I genuinely want to help other people who have been through what I have been through.

But I don‚Äôt know why becoming a cycle breaker became my path. I could‚Äôve perpetuated it all and continued the cycle. For some reason I didn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm grateful for whatever factors besides my own choice to heal were put into the equation without my knowledge. I wonder what factors were placed in my former friend‚Äôs equation that none of us were privy to."

I was totally shocked after being friends for 4 years to learn from another friend the ""oh s**t, you know them moment?"". Was shocked to learn the story because our friend does not get into relationships, she is just curious and crazy to try everything. The faces all 3 made when they all saw each other."

There are maybe a dozen commercial tuna species, with prices ranging from over $1M USD per fish for prime Japanese sushi market bluefin tuna,  on down to $3-$12/kg for other species/markets ( 
E.g., see Tridge) .  U.S. commercial bluefin fishery uses handlines and harpoons, focusing on top quality of the individual fish.  Bycatch is nearly non-existent in those fisheries:  you literally see exactly what you are targeting when you are harpooning. A portion of the quota is allocated to pelagic longline fisheries as bycatch in a designated area, and is relatively closely monitored. To say that trawling for tuna is ‚Äúpopular‚Äù seems like a stretch to me -  ICCAT catches of eastern bluefin totaled 37417 t in 2023.  Of that, only 410 t of that was by trawls.  These are likely midwater trawls, given that tuna are fast-swimming pelagic species."

I think a lot of the reason I didn't confide in my parents was because they, along with most of my friends, were super into purity culture. I think I had mild religious OCD. My mom also tended to overreact about little things or break my trust about things that I told her in confidence.

They were actually pretty permissive about most things, but they were always emotionally activated when talking about what I was and wasn't allowed to do with boys and my body. It makes me anxious just thinking about how on edge my mom was when she gave me ""the talk"" or how scandalized she acted when I asked her what a tampon was. Then, I broke the ultimate rule about being alone with a boy (because pretty much all teenagers with their hormones are going to break this rule). I knew they would victim blame and ignore my feelings because that's what they did for all the smaller stuff, too.

My mom even asked why I broke up with the first one. I told her that he wanted me to do things that I didn't want to do (not telling her the whole story), and she said, ""Well, I'm glad you didn't do anything."" It made my heart sink, and that's when I knew for sure that I could never tell her."

We were super drunk at his place one time after partying and we started talking about sex, then about fetishes, he asked me if I had a fetish and a said lingerie/feet, I think it's really common and when I asked him he said he liked kids.

I'm not sure if the thought that I was going to sympathize with him but I just told him, I'm so sorry, you need to get professional help.

The worst part is that he had a girlfriend at that time that knew about it, they even had a plan to have kids and have sex with them and teach them from a very young age that it was a normal way to express their love.

I couldn't sleep for weeks and I thought about what I could do, I threatened him to let our hr department know anonymously and he resigned so I didn't see him again. Then I tried to find his mom/dad to let them know that their son was a pedo, I did, on fb, but because they didn't accepted me as a friend I had to send a direct message to their inbox which to this day has not been seen, probably because it's on their message requests.

Then I found that he had a brother living in Canada and I reached out to him via ig to let him know, he was in complete denial, but because he had two young kids I thought that we would actually listen that his brother is a pedo."

And so the girl is telling the viewers to repeat her big manifesting lines. Stuff about, being open to the universe and its magic, and abundance. And there‚Äôs a line in there, show me a sign, so obvious, that it will be undeniable. She says, I will see a dinosaur, that‚Äôs how I‚Äôll know the sign. 

So there I am, heading to the store, grab lunch, in my open appreciative mind, I was ready to accept, the dinosaur themed stuff at the store as my sign, that things are okay and nice if you appreciate them so of course I‚Äôd see a dinosaur at the store and it‚Äôll anchor these peaceful intentions. And of course any skeptic would say it‚Äôs coincidence and self fullfilling, cus it would be. 

The real sign would be undeniable, well, I was walking to the store, taking an unusual route to it, there‚Äôs litter all over the secluded little path, rarely taken by anyone. There it was, a tiny plastic toy dinosaur, on the floor, middle of the path..  okay universe, I believe in you now. üòä."

I would head home (took about 5 minutes) and go out and ride my bike on empty bike paths. I was also taking some morning classes at the local community college so there was a lot of walking outside between classes or hanging out on the quad waiting for class to start. Then I usually had a hour or two to do whatever before going home to sleep. I would sleep from 1pm - 8pm and then head to work at 9.

Now, in the summer, it's too hot to do anything when I get off work in the summer. And then, in the winter, it's dark when I go to work and getting dark when I get off. That can get depressing."

I'm no fool i understand how i failed as a man which makes me unfit for relationship moving forward, i literally have to reincarnate and start over to be in more alignment with what women need/want from a man. so i'm in the desert and not lusting after women in any way to make them feel unsafe, EYES are still.....magnetized to booty sorta speak, i forgive myself for how i lived and move on, trying to be better."

Cut to 10-12 years down the road and I see an article on Facebook with his name on it and a bunch of comments from people who I worked with back then. Turns out he was in court for sexually trafficking his own 9-year-old daughter. His wife was complicit as well, and the comments from people ""close"" to him said they would join as well... I do not know what became of her. They threw the book at him, and he will never see the outside of a prison. Death would be too good for him.

He was caught because someone tipped off his supervisor who ran it up the chain. His wife somehow found out they (the military FBI) were coming for him. He was in a hotel room on a work trip when he got the call and cut his own wrists. They broke his door down and stopped him from bleeding out.

I think about that girl from time to time, even though she was born after I had already moved out of state. I hope she lives the life she deserves, but it still breaks my heart to think about how difficult every day must be for her.

Since you haven't done cocaine I'd like to share how those nights go. You start off with some drinks and then the person that can't party without a bag pulls out the bag. I've never done this before is what people say but often times they'll try it. So you do a little line, listen to some music and drink. You tend to drink more than usual because cocaine seems to negate the affects of alcohol. The next thing you know the bag is empty and you hear birds chirping. You realize that you've been up all night doing coke and drinking and now you need to sleep. Well you're not sleeping any time soon because coke. You may eventually fall asleep around lunch time when everything is worn off. Now you need some sleep as your body is in shock from being up all night on coke."

Because my first reaction when reading your opinion is ""that's ridiculous that every good thing would be to offset the bad they've done,"" and using OP's story about the old man who saved her daughter, I'd say that's more akin to ""people will do good things in the moment because that's their gut reaction."" You see a kid fall into a pool, you instinctively try to save them.

But the more I considered it, that's from my perspective of...not one of those people. Of course I'm not keeping score, because I haven't done these terrible things. Maybe people who are capable of these terrible things do have a sense of ""making up for"" the things they're doing?"

Them bringing it up themselves earns them a fair amount of credit, imo.  They could have just stayed silent and avoided the entire issue, but they chose to tell me about it instead.  At that point, if they tell me that it only happened once and they won't do it again, I'd probably believe them.  Because again, if they wanted to continue cheating on me, they could have just said nothing.

However, if I find out and confront them, then it's harder to give them a second chance.  It's possible that they truly did only do it once and do truly regret it.  However, it's also possible that they are lying through their teeth and are just trying to weasel out of the consequences.

Even someone that most people might consider ugly would be attractive to some people, again, that destroys you're argument. To say that it is based on facial similarity and is measurable is just ridiculous. 

And I will agree that people can be objectively talented or smart in certain things. Meryl Streep is an objectively talented actor. LeBron James is an objectively talented basketball player. Brian Cox is an objectively smart physicist.

What I'm saying is that not everyone values those things the same when considering a partner. Valuable talent is objective. I may not care that someone is a talented athlete, I don't value that as a good gene for breeding. 

The fact that you continue to misunderstand my point and make ridiculous claims shows that you are the low IQ one. And I'm making that claim based on the facts of this conversation, not just my feelings because I don't understand what you're saying."

2nd oldest is an anti-vax, conspiracy theorist, anti-science nut job who is RFK Jr.‚Äôs biggest fan.My nephews don‚Äôt even have SS numbers. I don‚Äôt care what happens to my brother at this point. Like, I do love him but I don‚Äôt like him very much and while I hope he sees the light eventually, he‚Äôs one of those people who is in love with how smart they are. I‚Äôve never in 30 something years heard him say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚ÄúI was wrong about -‚Äú so I‚Äôm not holding my breath.  But I‚Äôm genuinely concerned about my nephews and hope they are able to get away from their nutty parents.

My youngest and only full blood brother is dead to me. He‚Äôs in the TX national guard. Loves holding a gun, loves having power over people. He‚Äôs done a lot of border patrol work and loves catching Mexicans and sending them back. 
When I told him how much voting for Trump would hurt other people including me and my family his reaction was ‚ÄúSo? What m gonna do what‚Äôs best for me and even Trump is better than a democrat.‚Äù He became enraged when I told him he was not a good person lol üòÇ 

He hates women with a passion. The things I‚Äôve heard him say is deplorable. Yet he Talks all the time about how he wants a ‚Äúspicy‚Äù Latina woman or a ‚Äúsexy black lady‚Äù (he‚Äôs white AF in case you couldn‚Äôt tell) but says the most racist crap about black and Latino men.

He‚Äôs totally fine with what Trump is doing and is looking forward to suppressing and controlling people. He feels they deserve it and that the left just looks to cause problems and impede progress. While he‚Äôs not ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù per se, he will absolutely not ever turn on Trump and neither will the men he serves with. He would absolutely rather live in a fascist dictatorship than ever see a democrat, socialism or a woman in charge. It makes sense, he is a white Christian male, he stands to gain a lot by following Trump

Regardless, this is NOT the person I grew up with. He‚Äôs an active threat to anyone against the current regime and I can honestly say I hope he ends up in the ground soon so he doesn‚Äôt hurt any more people or bring any children into the world that he will hurt with his views and personality.

The message taped to my door called him every bad name in the book, and told him that I will go buy a wiffle bat and wake him up by beating him with it every time I got home.  I would do this for a month.  If you make me do this there will be no ""learning your lesson."" You WILL be woken up every single day at 3 am violently to ensure that you have trouble going back to sleep. 

The bottom notes were torn down.  But halfway up the staircase he apparently stopped tearing the notes off the wall and went back down.

Never woke me up after a late shift ever again. 

I left the notes up for a few days, then left the last note on my door for a few weeks. 

I'm not proud of it but holy fuck stop being an asshole I didn't work Sunday we could have worked on the yard then.  This was 100% a stupid power play that he lost"

We operate under a system of federalism that is contrary to a direct vote based on the roles and rights attributed to the national and state spheres. To the extent that system is in place, the electoral college is in place. Moving to a direct vote system would either need the acquiescence of all of the states (unlikley) or a (series of) Constitutional amendments (almost equally unlikely). The ""no reason"" doesn't really hold up. We may not agree with the reasons, but there are deeply entrenched reasons a direct vote won't happen. The proportional distribution model seeks to get mostly there while still reflecting the constitutional structure of states/nation relationships."

When you bring in experienced managers from the outside and stick them ontop of the existing team members, the existing team feels cheated while the new leadership doesn't fully understand the nuances of the business.

When you promote purely from within and stick new hires underneath them, you get a large pool of inexperienced leaders who are still learning (and struggling) in their role, which becomes challenging for the people under them.  The problem exacerbates when those promoted quickly don't lean those management fundamentals.

When you decide to mix-and-match for the best of both worlds, you get insecurity/envy in the company because those who didn't get promoted look at other teams and see all of the other people they've worked with for years getting promotions."

No point in leashing Mrs Pelosi if Mr Pelosi can act on that info.

Ultimately, your position becomes ""if you know enough to make a good trade, you shouldn't be allowed to make a trade"". Which means the problem wasn't the people doing the trading, it was the trading itself.

2025-08-14 18:25:42+00:00,"Yep, my mom was repeatedly abused by her father and her mother didn't do a thing. She's been caring for her mother for decades, she sees her daily, gets her all her groceries, etc.

Many years back, she told me she'd finally confronted her mother and asked her why she didn't do anything. Her mother's response? 

""You should've closed your legs, you little slut.""

She was devastated. She never shared that kinda stuff with me, so I was shocked to hear it. I asked her why she bothered going back over there and helping her so much. No response. I told her that no child is ever at fault for what adults do to them and that what she said was irredeemably reprehensible, so it was best for her to stop doing her all these favors. She just mumbled something like ""I have to though"". No logical response. Just blind, unconditional acceptance at how she was treated. 

The kicker is that my father was also very abusive, as were my brothers, to me. And my mom never did anything about it and even seemed to take delight in it because she's the ""boy mom"" type. I was beaten badly and regularly, my pets were murdered in front of me, every single material item I ever owned was destroyed by 14 years old. But they never molested me. 

So later in life after her mother's gross utterance, I confronted her myself. She admitted to me that she didn't count anything as abuse unless it was molestation and insisted that I was the villain for ""living in the past"" instead of just accepting ongoing abuse forever. Typical narcissist script. 

So I reminded her of when she confronted her own mother. How she couldn't comprehend how her mother could care so little for her. How profoundly it effected her. And I congratulated her for becoming her mother before blocking her and cutting contact for the last time.

2025-08-14 18:26:08+00:00,"It‚Äôs been a decade since I worked nights and what everyone else has said is true one thing I haven‚Äôt seen anyone say is about meetings.  I worked 6pm to 6am if I was relieved on time.  Day shift would usually shut down for a half hour at the end of their shift so maintenance could inspect the conveyers and what not.  So we would get there at 6pm have our meeting and go out to our positions and start up the plant again.  Day shift would leave on time every day.  On night shift we would ‚Äúhot shift‚Äù the plant.  So day shift would get there at 6am have their meeting, catch up with people they just saw 12 hours ago, talk about the news and relieve us at about 6:30-6:45 and be surprised when we were upset that they took forever to relieve us.  Also day/night shift meetings would always be at 6am so that day shift didn‚Äôt have to stay past 6pm or didn‚Äôt have to wake up early.  If there was an employee appreciation thing, they would do it at 5pm and if we didn‚Äôt come in early we didn‚Äôt get anything.  If we had to work on Sunday, day shift would get lunch brought in.  Nothing was open for night shift so we were out of luck.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I liked night shift.  It‚Äôs quiet, layed back, none of the brass are around and you usually make more money but hire ups really don‚Äôt give a shit about you either.  Also this was before DND so fuck the managers who think they can call you at 1pm when you work 96 hours a week.  Just wait a couple hours you‚Äôll see me again."

2025-08-14 18:26:15+00:00,"You‚Äôre moving in the right direction, but your answer is still full of incorrect myth about the founding and why the EC exists.

There is no need for the electoral college.  We have literally NEVER USED THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AS INTENDED. The main reason we use the electoral college is because our Founders were making it up as they went along, and didn‚Äôt have any live models to look at.  This is quite literally it.

There are two obvious ways to pick a chief executive in a legislative democracy: (1) the people vote, (2) the legislature votes.  **Every democracy in the world**, besides the US, uses one of these methods. So does every state in the US.  

And, of course, these obvious solutions were quickly proposed at the convention.  But both were rejected.  The legislature voting was rejected because they thought it would compromise checks and balances, and lead to back room dealings.  The popular vote was vetoed because the slave states didn‚Äôt want their strength diluted by only counting citizens (slaves can‚Äôt vote), and because folks were concerned regular citizens wouldn‚Äôt be familiar with the candidate pool in the Capitol (which would be the reps from around the country) and would be susceptible to demagoguery.

So the question inquired until the end of the convention, and was tossed to the Committee on Unfinished Parts to make a proposal. They settled on a compromise: we‚Äôd use a system like the Vatican‚Äôs College of the Cardinals when they pick a pope.  The electors would be picked every cycle and then dissolved, to reduce corruption.  The electors would be wise men familiar with the candidates, insulated from popular passions.  

It was good enough, so they chose it.

And we never implemented it.  The first two terms were unanimous for Washington.  But by the next president, the dream of a learned body coming to reasoned decision was already fallen into party politics.  And voters realized they actually didn‚Äôt want their president chosen in a secret back room deal, so states quickly began rescinding the electors discretion and running statewide votes to assign them. 

So now we have a popular election, with the popular votes put through a weighting system to advantage the coalition that hits more narrow majorities in large states. In makes no sense, nobody every asked for it, and it serves no purpose."

2025-08-14 18:26:25+00:00,"Different roles often implies unequal power. Historically, these ‚Äúroles‚Äù place the husband in authority and the wife in submission, that is a power imbalance, even if sugar coated.
Being ‚Äúequal in value‚Äù but unequal in decisionmaking or autonomy is still inequality. 
Equality is not only about worth, but also about rights, choices, and autonomity. So it is sexist.

Purity culture does more harm then good. Its proven that relationship skills are more important in marrige than if someone had premartial sex or not.

""Love the sinner, hate the sin"", still, it comes with harm and exclusion towards the individual. And the apparent fact that homosexuality goes against nature is questionable since same sex relationships or engagements have been observed in hurdreds of animals. Not just humans. Why are humans the only ones where its a problem.

If rejecting christianity comes with threats of eternal torment, is it realy ""free will"". I like to compare it to being held at gunpoint and given a choice which depending on what you chose you either live or get shot. Its not free will in that case. Its coercion. 

The nature of faith is holding something as true without evidance. Which is not logical. And has nothing to do with critical thinking.

I was at one of those game and movie trade shops going around the aisles when I heard this really rough sounding dude kinda loud-whisper to the kid something like ""and if you make a sound I'll fucking stomp your ass"" before he proceeds to pinch the kid really hard.

Apparently the poor kids mom was in another aisle and I think this was a ""Mom's boyfriend is a worthless piece of shit"" situation.

I was like ""hey dude, I saw that shit."" and he just grumbled at me to mind my business and when I saw him go closer to the mom I told her what he just did. The sad part was, she actually looked like she got really scared and kinda ducked her head down a bit more.

Everyone else that sounded so sincere offering help were crickets when actual help for the smallest things were asked.  The guy that helped didn‚Äôt even ask, he just showed up.  I actually didn‚Äôt need help, I was working on the house for a few weeks and just wanted someone around for a bit.  Things like my investment accounts have a beneficiary listed as well.  My cars have a Transfer on Death beneficiary and my moms house will be put in my own Trust with a beneficiary. so the only stuff that will be in probate are my physical things in the house.  

The only thing that I can‚Äôt put a beneficiary on is a retirement fund that goes for life. The only way to share that is if I was married. If I am not, then it just stops paying out.

In fact, people drive less in general, and make lifestyle choices around the premise that traveling with a lot of stuff on a daily basis is costly and wasteful.

In the US, you can commute 50 miles a day in a full size pickup truck and doing so will only cost you ten bucks or so in fuel, which turns out to be below a lot of people's threshold of changing behavior over cost.

If the difference in cost between taking a bus and driving your APC to work was more than the cost of a latte, then more people would be talking about fuel efficiency they way boomers talk down to people  about lattes."

CEO said no we don‚Äôt want the cops in our office and let that get out on news and all. Bad for business, yada yada.

President told CEO in front of me , if this ever comes up again I will go to Board and have you removed  if you try to down play it again. CEO was out within three months of this occurring because Board found out how he reacted and due to financial issues that were happening, it was not a good outcome for CEO.  After arrest I had to go to court due to him being arrested from work and all, was horrified what they charged the guy with.  Apparently he had apartment full of CP and had came south (from up North Boston and that area) because he had a background of issues with this kind of behavior!!

2025-08-14 18:30:03+00:00,"No.

In 2017, we all collectively agreed that bosses and managers shouldn't take advantage of their employees and that it's nearly impossible to consent when your boss is the person propositioning you and I'm not going to pretend it's okay just because she's a woman. My former boss is a disgusting person. She shouldn't be in a position of power, especially not when she has power over children. If anything, the way she treated me after I complained is an indication that consent was not possible. He could not consent to that relationship. The fact that I was dragged into all of it because she was lying about it was an even bigger red flag. 

I stand by what I did. I had to leave that school. Fine. I went to another in the district and, after that one closed I ended up out of work and I don't feel bad about it. I'm worried money, but I'd rather have integrity and it's much more important to me that my employer understand that she can't be abusive toward me. They were not allowed to abuse me in that way. I do not regret it for a second."

Gentlemen, please schedule a comfortable and sit down conversation with your lady. Be vulnerable, be compassionate. Ask her what she needs. Trust that if she loves you and her needs are met, she will want to feel sexy and intimate again. It's just a matter of getting her used to feeling taken cared of again (when she spends so much time caring for small people who combat her all day.)

The second my husband and I sat down and divvied up household expectations, it became so much easier to know where we both needed to be during the busy times. And when I finally found time where I knew my duties were done and my husband would handle the rest, I could finally focus so much more energy on intimacy. 

It's so hard you guys. It requires so much effort and vulnerability and most of all, compassion. But once you find a rhythm it can flourish again in no time."

It's a good arrangement.  Brother looks after some elderly relatives most of the time, and they in turn become the first-line help & alert system when brother gets seizures.

My husband doesn't refer to him by name, but rather as ""brother"" or ""brother of mine"".  It melts my heart when my brother needs help & my husband says it with concern.  When my brother gets too entitled or demanding any other time, my husband's voice reaches a new low register as he glowers and intones *brother of mine*.  

Yeah life threw us some curves, but given that it happened then this is the best outcome. What more could I ask for."

2025-08-14 18:34:18+00:00,"I had  experiences with banks when I was young that made me never patronize Wells Fargo or BofA again. Crocker, which Wells took over, had an early version of an IRA. I started it in 1980 with a $500 deposit, but being a part time working student, I never was able to contribute to it. Shoulda read the fine print. No, REALLY shoulda read the fine print. You had virtually no control over investments, and if you didn't deposit the minimum amount of, I think, something like $50/month, they charged fees. EXORBITANT fees. And I only got an annual notice, no monthly reminders. I eventually withdrew it and after taxes and penalties, netted a grand total of $200...5 years later. My own fault, but also a rigged game. Also, I'll confess, a good lesson in money management. I learned to read fine print! 

BofA, on the other hand, was a constant struggle to maintain minimum checking account balances as a poor student working part and full time. The monthly fees would eat away at my low balance, and for what? Access at ATMs when I didn't have money in the account? I eventually left for Washington Mutual because their fees were more reasonable, but the minute a credit union offered universal ATM access, I jumped ship.  It's been at least 25 years with the same CU, and I will never, EVER go back to a commercial bank. No fees, better interest, and no fucking upselling of financial ""products."" BTW, I had to go into a Wells Fargo about 5 years ago to deposit money into my goddaughter's account. Jeez, banks are looking might scuzzy these days-everything was dusty, furniture looked ratty, the clientele were even scuzzier. Being a teller or a manager is, as someone said above, just a glorified retail clerk these days."

2025-08-14 18:34:23+00:00,"I had an older friend that was like a brother for a few years when I was around the time I graduated highschool. We had a business together and lived next door to each other for a few years. This was on a compound (large business, not a cult) in a tourist town where we worked together. There were also young women (ranging from 16-30 years old) who lived there working for the summer. We always got into relationships with them, but mostly just friends. (For context, I married one of them and we've been together for over twenty years now). 

One summer there was a girl who instantly hit it off with this guy, who I had seen date girls way too young for him. She only worked there for a few weeks before going back home for school. He said he felt guilty because he went too far with her one day while making out. Not long after that I moved away and haven't hung out with him since. I ran into that girl at work a few years later and she cornered me almost immediately. She said that friend raped her. She also told me that she was much younger than I remembered her being (my mistake), she was only 16. I remembered what he said and his attitude for a while and think she was telling the truth. I didn't know what to say, and probably didn't handle it well. But my feelings were that he should pay for any crimes, even though I still thought of him as a brother. Weirdly her shift changed and she had to quit the next week. I moved on with my life and never really got any answers. I know that guy helped someone else, a young rape victim, get justice including being a witness in court (completely unrelated). Just weird and I will never really be able to wrap my head around it."

2025-08-14 18:36:10+00:00,"I think a lot of people fall into the same mindset, and while I vehemently disagree, I do understand where you're coming from and why some people feel like medication isn't the answer. The fact is that medication isn't the answer for everyone, and even when it is the answer, medication alone isn't a silver bullet to cure everything. 

That being said for the overwhelming majority of people suffering from any form of mental illness will benefit from medication.  While it won't immediately cure you, it will absolutely help mitigate some of the worst of it, allowing you to work through whatever you're dealing with. 

If you got hit by a bus tomorrow and ended up in the hospital with multiple broken bones, would you tell the doctors no actually I don't want pain relief those are drugs? There's absolutely nothing wrong with benefiting from the decades of study from the medical field for either your physical or mental health. 

Nobody sensible will advise you to ignore what doctors are suggesting in any other situation but suddenly when it comes to mental health issues everyone's an expert and wants to tell you what you need to do to feel better. I don't think that comes from a bad place most of the time, but ignorant advice from an uneducated mind is often worse than malicious advice because at least it's easier to spot the latter. 

There are some illnesses like adhd for example, that absolutely require medication for the overwhelming majority of people. You could be the exception, but simply telling yourself you should be better is the least helpful thing you can do and will often make things worse when you're unable to just wish yourself back to full health. 

Change is incredibly hard. It requires tremendous effort and, most importantly, help sometimes that's medication based sometimes talking to someone often its a combination of both. When your own mind is actively working against you, it's usually the absolute last thing that you should be trusting when it comes to how to get better, especially when its suggestions aren't productive."

However how many decades do we need before they can see that change is needed?

Global warming - still denied (largely, or at least thought of as something humans can't cause)

Gun restrictions - impossible in any form, regardless of how many mass shootings we have

The Constitution - the stated goal of many of the SCOTUS is this innocuous claim of ""original intent"" - or, reading it in a way that denies any sort of change.

Economics - despite rising inequality and wage stagnation, they still adhere to a version of Reagonomics 

Societal -  They adhere to (largely)  Christian ideals of right  and wrong and want those standards forced on everyone, for example the 10 commandments should be in school but not any other doctrines.  This is just one example

2025-08-14 18:37:46+00:00,"Most of the replies here are around one or both having medical issues preventing sex to occur. That's one thing but I'm sure this post is about if you are healthy and still not having sex. My suggestion if you are looking to have sex and not getting it is to use dread. Go on dates with other women/men, maybe even have sex outside of the marriage if warranted. Life is short, sex is one of the best things on earth and we all have the right to experience it regularly. People can always tell when someone is well-fucked. Your partner will also be able to tell even if they can't pin it down or find concrete proof. 

In my marriage I said from day one that I'm in control of sex, not her. This is because I'm high testosterone and will get upset if I'm not getting it regularly. She agreed and the saying goes ""when do we have sex? whenever one of us wants it"" 

There are times that we don't have sex every day, but or the most part we do almost daily. If it's not happening, use dread and straight up tell her you will be going elsewhere for sex if it doesn't happen. You are not a roommate, you are a romantically engaged couple that deserve one of life's greatest pleasures. She/he isn't giving it, go find elsewhere and you may find that you are much better as a partner for doing this, nothing against the other but they are lacking and you have the right to go find it.

One final point, someone might not be ""in the mood"" but you know what happens the second you engage in intercourse, everyone likes it, everyone (even those who don't ""like"" to do it) becomes happier after the fact, so she/he can suck it up and get the job done. Fuck those who say it's not that important or just put up with no sex for weeks/months/years that's an awful way of looking at it."

Some people are monogamous, some people are poly. Some people are gay, some are straight. Some people dont want anything sexual, some want only sex and no emotional connection.

I am personally not capable of being in love with two people at once. That is a lot of feelings and I am just not wired that way. I prefer monogamy or solitude. Some people though, like my friend are wired the complete opposite. BAM thanks nature for keeping it diverse.

I was slapping her pussy while her whole lower body was tense and she was doing the short-breath thing. Then she slapped my hand away, stuck her legs in the air like a mighty V, arched her back, and began brutally slapping her own clit while panting. Then she let out a bloodcurdling scream and began sort of thrusting her hips while doing this. Then she said ""oh motherfucker, it's not happening"" and went limp and lay there panting.

As long as states' role in elections as intermediaries. if you will, is part of our Constutional structure, we can't just move to direct voting with amendment.

Firstly the Addams work because its a window into the weird from a normal perspective, it works because theyde contrasted against regular society at all times. This isnt that. This is Harry Potter with Wednesday. And it just doesnt land.

Secondly everyone in the family is incompetent except for Wednesday. Pugsley is a weak loser, Fester cant jaywalk without getting arrestedn and Gomez is a bufoon. In what world would Gomez be on the backfoot in a sword duel when 'Tish is on the line, AND be afraid of dying. That should the time of his life.

Spent over $800 on tires, and when I went to my car after I paid I noticed the drivers door wasn't completely closed. I pulled the handle and the door popped open and almost fell off. They had somehow broken the hinge, and rather than do anything about it, they just forced the door closed, which broke it much worse. The worst part was that they didn't say anything to me about it. I went back in and told the owner I needed to show him some damage and he flat out denied that they broke the door, and that it was like that when I brought it in because I drove a shitty car. Looking back I should have taken them to small claims for the damage, but I was young and didn't know better. The best part was I told my dad and him and everybody in his company stopped buying their work truck tires there, which they all replaced 2-3 times a year for about $5k each time. So, them breaking my door probably cost them $50k+ from the lost revenue of all of those truck tires."

2025-08-14 18:41:10+00:00,"Asperger‚Äô Children by Edith Sheffer. 

A groundbreaking exploration of the chilling history behind an increasingly common diagnosis.
Hans Asperger, the pioneer of autism and Asperger syndrome in Nazi Vienna, has been celebrated for his compassionate defense of children with disabilities. But in this groundbreaking book, prize-winning historian Edith Sheffer exposes that Asperger was not only involved in the racial policies of Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich, he was complicit in the murder of children.
As the Nazi regime slaughtered millions across Europe during WWII, it sorted people according to race, religion, behavior, and physical condition for either treatment or elimination. Nazi psychiatrists targeted children with different kinds of minds‚Äïespecially those thought to lack social skills‚Äïclaiming the Reich had no place for them. Asperger and his colleagues endeavored to mold certain ‚Äúautistic‚Äù children into productive citizens, while transferring others they deemed untreatable to Spiegelgrund, one of the Reich‚Äôs deadliest child-killing centers.
In the first comprehensive history of the links between autism and Nazism, Sheffer uncovers how a diagnosis common today emerged from the atrocities of the Third Reich. With vivid storytelling and wide-ranging research, Asperger‚Äôs Children will move readers to rethink how societies assess, label, and treat those diagnosed with disabilities."

One day, I was googling a different former acquaintance, who had been the head of a club I was in until he got charged with committing a million dollar fraud against his employer (he was head of purchasing IT equipment and set up shell companies that got paid for not delivering anything or delivering cheaper computers), revenge porn, and stalking his ex.

In the another section of the crime section of the news website, I saw my acquaintance who worked in the convenience and stationery store. A couple of decades ago, a serial paedophile had drugged, abducted, raped, and murdered the acquaintance's daughter. Her body has never been found. Over the years, the paedophile had lied about where he buried the daughter. The paedophile was in the news because he was dying and probably never going to reveal the real location of the daughter's body."

2025-08-14 18:43:54+00:00,"Yes.  In no small part to the fact that he's already done this for me.  

We got together when I was 15.  At 18, I developed a drinking problem, was extremely depressed living on my own for the first time and having a crisis of sexuality while being deeply involved in my fundamentalist church.  I cheated on him with one of my friends when we were blackout drunk one night. We were still together and in fact engaged.   We didn't get married till I was 20.  I believe I was 22 or 23 when I finally told him because I couldn't handle the guilt anymore.  It was hard.  I got into therapy. We talked a lot.  And I was lucky that he chose to forgive me both for my actions and for not telling him sooner.  I was more than lucky but I just don't really have the words to describe how fortunate and thankful I am to him.  Don't have the words for the regret and confusion and love I have for him.

Anyway I'm 36 now.  I'm out, no longer part of the church and we're still together and honestly happier and more honest and open now than ever.  We are monogamous.

Now because I understand the feelings of curiosity and confusion and all the complicated feelings about experience and the like, I've told him that if he ever has the desire to pursue someone that I would understand.  Or like if he has a need that I'm not fulfilling because I can't or won't for some reason (we do have a great sex life as it stands) then I would understand him wanting to find a way to have that fulfilled.  So mostly I would be CONFUSED on the need to cheat (doing this without my knowledge of it) when I've made it clear that I wouldn't stand in the way of his needs or curiosity (we've otherwise only ever been with each other and curiosity is natural). 

TLDR: yes, but I'd mostly be confused."

2025-08-14 18:44:15+00:00,"Not married but been together 4 years. We're super young and just moved to a new city. We had an issue w her infidelity about 2.5 years ago that really put a damper on intimacy until about a year ago. I struggle with hypersexuality due to CSA and when I met her she talked about how high her libido was and I shared I was the same. I quickly learned we had two different ideas of ""high"" and after our rough patch it was nice trying to at least work on that part of us. Since then it's been periods of maybe a week or two where we'll be really intimate in more ways than just physically then long stretches of no sex, no general intimacy at all, and feeling like I'm wanting a relationship while I'm in my relationship until she decides she's into it again. Recently those long stretches have resulted in me not wanting to do it at all. Sex is (unfortunately?) the deepest way I connect with a partner I show parts of myself I can't help but to reveal in that vulnerability and I become very dependent on after care and the other parts of pre and post sex that make it enjoyable and intimate and linear but now it feels like having sex would be redundant. It doesn't feel mutual like I'm just scratching a rare itch for her and licking my internal wounds until she decides to look at me again. I've also unfortunately gained weight in the past years and that makes me feel even worse. Sometimes I wish I could just go find someone else but ik it's hard to find someone with even a fraction of the compatibility we have in other areas of our relationship so I stay and hope this will change but deep down I feel like shit for wanting more sex from my partner like some entitled chauvinist."

2025-08-14 18:44:23+00:00,"When I was a baker at a union shop, I had a boss who actually studied our collective agreement to figure out what he could and couldn't do to us via scheduling.  Giving people he was mad at shitty hours was basically his one power move, and he held onto it for years.

But when COVID happened, it gave me room to go over his head to suggest staggered shifts; getting as much stocking & baking work done outside open hours; and midnight starts over what had always been 2:30am or 3:30am starts, so that we were out of the store shortly after customers started arriving.  His go-to move with me after that was to put me on days, stocking the floor, because he knew I was heavily partial to nights; and he was able to argue for ""business needs""-- even though there were also other employees who would rather work those shifts than my midnight baking shifts, and he was making the whole team miserable to get at one person.  

My union gave me the ability to go part-time, and restrict my hours so he could only schedule me at certain times, but hours were doled out to full-timers first, and then the ""anytimers"", and *then* the restricted staff; and I was low enough in seniority within my department that doing this would've left me with about 16 hours a week when things were slow.

But!  One magical day, about 5 years into the job, a couple years into the pandemic, and a slightly different team later, I realized I'd reached top of the seniority list out of our available bakers, and was in a position to restrict my hours while still getting ~32 a week.  I tailored my availability to be exactly the schedule I wanted if I was given a full week's worth of shifts.  I was so excited!

My boss was not.  He'd had me baking 2 nights a week, and then working 3 days, and had been pleased as a pig in mud for ages that he found a way to do that to me that the union couldn't shut down.  He decided that his response to this would be to drag his heels and continue scheduling me 2 nights a week.  I got the union involved, and he doubled down.  I approached him directly for a good-faith discussion on how we could get me up to 20-25 hours a week (what I needed to support myself) in a way that made both of us happy, and he just wordlessly looked at me like I was crazy, while shaking his head.

He was told by his bosses and the union that he had to explain how & why his choices were meeting ""business needs"" better than just scheduling his team according to regular policy.  He tried; he could not.  So his boss took over scheduling for our department.  I decided it looked like a good time to go to management with about 6 years of documentation on his patterns of behaviour.  An investigation was initiated-- and, much to my surprise, my team fully backed me when interviewed; even though one of them was actually a friend of boss outside of work, and most were usually scared of his backlash when it came time to speak up.  It was looking really good for me.

So, naturally, boss up & took ""stress leave"" right as things were concluding, and never came back.  Yes, it was still just as satisfying as if he'd been fired.  Good riddance."

I went to an art school for college and tried to convince him to come and do film or music with me so we could get better at what we were doing. He got in a car crash hit by a 18 wheeler and he was never the same again. Years later I read an article that he attacked a random person in a city park with a baseball bat and bashed her skull in."

I personally shut down any time someone raises their voice to me. It's clear they don't respect others so I'm not going to respect them.  Want me to listen to you, talk to me like an adult with an indoor voice.

Literally anybodys voice going above a rational tone is unacceptable if the person they're talking to is right in front of them/in the same room. It's 100% disrespectful to the other party. Shows you have 0 emotional control when you get upset and are behaving like a child's tantrum.

I believe this with parents too. No parent should raise their voice. If you can't talk to them in a Stern Respectable tone and feel the need to yell, YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PARENT."

It's the latest political boogeyman, in a previous century it was the Red Communists and before that it was Imperialism. We've seen this dance over and over again.

>Gun restrictions - impossible in any form, regardless of how many mass shootings we have

Address the ill people pulling the trigger, not the means which can be anything.

>The Constitution - the stated goal of many of the SCOTUS is this innocuous claim of ""original intent"" - or, reading it in a way that denies any sort of change.

The job of the courts is to read and interpret the laws as written. It is the job of the legislature and the electorate to change the law, including amending the Constitution which requires clearing some high bars.

>Economics - despite rising inequality and wage stagnation, they still adhere to a version of Reagonomics

Both sides of the aisle are to blame for the failed economic and fiscial policies of the past century.

>Societal - They adhere to (largely) Christian ideals of right and wrong and want those standards forced on everyone

The same can be said of the Left/Progressives, just change out ""Christian ideals"" with whatever suits their fancy. Both sides of the aisle are guilty of this act.

We operate within individual capacity and with influence from the herd and institutions.

I know humans have had a dichotomous nature for a long time. Either-Or thinking contributes to a lot of our perceived issues. 

The categorization and the narrative can be helpful when making sense of things, but maybe at some point, we began living the narrative alone and separated from that life essence.

A lot of learned destructive behavior.

Thinking to the nature of things... organisms seek homeostasis, so the loss of meaning from lacking presence in life while defining the parameters of life, seems to lead to suffering.

Then, we perpetuate the suffering by continuing the narrative and not fully showing up. Basing our lives mostly on things other people imagined up centuries ago, even when it's clearly not working out for the majority.

So, the human condition is stupidity. Imo."

I said sure, no policy against that, we have to dispose of it down the drain. He told me to check the bushes outside his room after checkout time, his country didn't allow importation of alcohol and he accidentally bought too much and didn't want it to go waste. I found a box with 12 bottles of whiskey. 3 empty, 5 open in various levels of consumption, 4 unopened. I looked it up, it's about $300 a bottle for Amador Whiskey back then, probably more now. 

I was like ""what the fuck, this guy just throws a party and gives away over a thousand of booze to the cleaner?"" But hey, he's a bro. I took it, and told my coworkers about it but didn't mention the 4 unopened. They thought I was sharing 5 open bottles in the part of the downstairs hallway that had no cameras."

Although to me it then further highlights a situation with the example of OP's story. Which is sort of related, but not exactly the same. 

In your example you're listing two premeditated acts to balance/offset each other. Gym, junk food. Conscious decisions thought about with some sort of planning or intention.

OP's example has an instinctive, reactionary, little to no thought act; a truly gut reaction to a potentially catastrophic situation in which a life was saved, an action that basically everyone would consider ""good.""

On the other side of the scale is these heinous, awful, brutally harmful acts that are done with intention, premeditation, intent. Acts that basically everyone would consider bad or ""evil.""

I'm rambling a bit here, but I'm intrigued by the idea of an ""evil"" person still making instinctual ""good"" decisions/reactions without the benefit of time to consider the ""karmic offset"" so to speak.

My partner sews me things, like underwear, sweatpants, and today I'm wearing a shirt she made me yesterday while she was off work for the day. It fits me so great, made out of really pretty fabric, and it doesn't look like anything you'd see in a store. Swoon. I like stuff like that so much more than gifts. 

Other than that just quality time. I think men really value quality time connecting, just like women do. Yes intimacy is part of that, but it's not all of it. Intimacy is the best when you feel such a strong connection to your partner, and men crave that too. So if you create a special evening and spend time talking and laughing and having a good time and especially if it's orchestrated to lead to that, you literally feel on top of the world, the next day you have so much spring in your step.

Pretty much up until the ‚Äúeureka moment,‚Äù most of it is true.


My only solution to the dog eating trash is to empty the can more frequently than you need to. 


But mainly, we use good ol fashioned toilet paper every time the girls pee, and most of the time we poop. And I‚Äôd be willing to bet my son (who is the main wet wipe user) flushes it half the time.



Honestly though, I‚Äôd recommend a diaper genie if you‚Äôre doing most of your shitting in one bathroom. We had two kids 19 months apart and the older of those two is developmentally delayed. Their older sister is three years older than the boy, so we had a diaper genie in the house for around 7 years. Half that time we were double duty, and those things did well to not smell bad with actual shit-filled diapers in them. 


I suspect with poop going down the pipes and just wipes in the DG, it wouldn‚Äôt ever stink if you cut the bag and tossed it weekly. A little Febreeze in there before you tie up the bag after."

I mean being silly, ""cringe"", funny, or immature in a lighthearted way.

I have this perception that after a certain age, especially if you have a job or a family, you have to act composed and serious at all times. Is that true? Will people judge or make fun of you for occasionally acting like your younger self, even if you're generally mature?

Sorry if this question seems silly, but it's something I really want to keep, even if it sometimes feels wrong,especially when adulthood comes with so many responsibilities and expectations.üòÖ"

2025-08-14 18:53:04+00:00,"A friend and I were both having a hard time, so we decided to get drunk in her room and ended up hooking up. 

During foreplay, she told me to ""lick Tom Cruise,"" which was VERY confusing to my drunk ass. I was looking around for like a Tom Cruise poster or something when she yelled ""lick him! Lick Tom Cruise!"" and then used her fingers to make it clear that she meant her vagina. Still confusing, but I got it and obliged. 

Later she pushed me down on my back and said ""Pink Thunder, I want to torment you. Let me torment you!"" Alright, I'm into kink, so I'm down for this. So not knowing what was about to happen, I got ready as she climbed on and started riding me. I was waiting for the torment to start, and just as I thought she might have forgotten her plan to bring some pain into this, she starts riding faster and harder and leans down into my face yelling ""does it hurt!? DOES IT HURT!?"" This is REALLY funny in hindsight, but at the time it was strangely hot lol.

Also, the ENTIRE time we were hooking up she was doing a Russian accent lol

The next morning, I asked her why she called her vagina ""Tom Cruise,"" and she was like ""did I really do that? That's so weird and I have no idea."" Then I asked her about the ""torment/does it hurt"" thing, and she just laughed and was like ""I don't know, it's just something I do sometimes.""

We weren't exactly FWB. We were really good friends and only hooked up a couple more times over the years. She was one of the most zany, eccentric, fun people I've ever known. Kinda like a real life manic pixie dream girl. We would hang out all the time and it was always a blast.

A few years later, she got together with this guy who seemed sketch and her friends, me included, started seeing her less and less. I really wish I'd tried harder to intervene because  her becoming distanced from her friends was an obvious red flag, but, you can't force someone to leave a sketchy guy. Eventually he strangled her to death. It breaks my heart every time I think about her. She was so cool and we never had any drama or anything like that. Just a shit-load of fun and occasionally helping each other through tough times. It's been over a decade and I still think about her all the time and miss her dearly. I wish my wife  could have met her. She and my wife are both super whimsical and I think they would have loved each other."

My other coworker came up to the first coworker, in front of me, and just started screaming at her to stay in lane and that it wasn‚Äôt her choice to make that change. I thought the second coworker was going to hit her. I had never seen anything so volatile, I ran to another coworker, who told me this happens a lot and just to ignore it.

Father died in the altercation, and the 2 guys get charged with murder for having committed a felony during which someone died. The two guys got sentenced to death, and the supreme court ruled that even though they weren't involved in the murders, had no intent to commit murder, and had no previous thought about committing murder, they could be sentenced to death."

He hired me and a couple friends to help paint his garage and when we were hanging out at his house we find the most ridiculous collection of pictures and memorabilia from his insane life. Over the years he had been a WW2 vet, a Harlem Globetrotter, a studio musician and a character actor who had lots of small bits in movies and TV shows. Well he was such a cool dude and he had worked in so many big industries that he had got to know a ton of huge stars from back in the day. He had photos of him at house parties and dinners with people like Robert Redford, Miles Davis, Richard Pryor, Kareem Abdul-Jabar etc. Like, *massive* stars in entertainment and sports from the 60s-70s.

2025-08-14 18:56:52+00:00,"I had a roleplay partner who was this person. For those who don't know, roleplaying is when two people collaboratively write stories, and they can sometimes be fanfiction-equivalent or be totally original. Each person creates/chooses their own characters and writes their reactions/actions, advancing the story. Like DnD with text only and no numbers.

My partner lived and breathed anime. She would discuss it at length like it was her one special interest. It seemed like she'd seem everything and had big opinions on all of them. Apparently she'd even tried to make an anime analysis YouTube at one point. I like anime, I've met people who are really into it, but she was a total type A who took it to the point of studying it like academia. She was *passionate.*

We ended up creating a behemoth of a story that would span several Google doc pages per post. She would joke that she had just gotten out of meetings and all she could think about was what had just happened in our story. Sometimes she would even post while she was at work in her phone despite the sheer length and quality- she was an *excellent* writer (and this was pre AI, no doubt it was authentic, she had a *voice*). I thought it was wild, I'd never met anyone so invested. Even though we spoke from dawn to dusk for months, it felt like she was always at work.

But as I got to know her, she told me about her job and it was way, way more prestigious than I thought. I was actually flooded; this was a girl who regularly said things like ""8'DDDDD YYYASSSSs omiGAAAWWGWHHDJSBSBSYSG"" to virtually anything. So I asked her ""what do you think your underlings would think if they found out you were a weeb who was thinking about anime boys with superpowers all day?""

She sent me a quick "">_>;;"", then proceeded to tell me a story about how she showed up to the company costume party in full Sasuke cosplay. That's how everyone found out.

We disconnected some months later because that's how it goes, but man, Im so sad I didn't get to be one of those people at the corporate party that found out their boss was an absolute Narutard. If only they knew she called herself ""boss lady >83"". When you look at her, you wouldn't guess it at all."

2025-08-14 18:58:06+00:00,"There are plenty of examples of what is a city problem:  
\* Gun Control - Cities have a lot of people, they also have a huge police presence, dialing 911 has someone at your doorstep within 5 minutes in a city like NYC, thats unrealistic in rural New York State.  
   \* This also includes self defense situations on things like wild life, you wont find a bear in downtown manhattan for example.  
\* Minimum Wage - A city like new york needs a much higher minimum wage then a rural town in upstate new york. If you force small businesses to have a 30 dollar minimum wage in upstate new york they go out of business because it doesnt match the cost of living in the area  
\* Land use and development - Cities have strict districting rules in order to manage and maintain the large populations they have, the countryside does not. This affects industrial and economic development of those small towns.  
\* Focus around mass transit - Cities benefit greatly while the country side sees little to no benefit, if you take their voice away you basically do taxation without real representation

Plenty more examples if you just google it but the point is that cities fundamentally care about different problems from rural communities. If you did a solely population based system, functionally yes, the needs of the many would outweigh the needs of the few, but realistically it would just hurt the countryside forcing more people to move into the cities which would make the current housing situation, job situation, and food situation much worse."

Her and I reconnected recently. What she told me had my jaw on the floor. He got them evicted from their apartment because he simply wasnt paying the rent. She and the roommate were giving him their share and he was partying it away. Her and my ex moved into his parents place but then he starts staying late at work and being suspicious.¬†


Turns out he got a DUI in his affair partners car end of October 2024. Affair partner is also an addict so 4 months of their relationship she was in rehab. They got engaged in May 2025 after being together 7 months. Affair partner is 25F and he is 38M. He's a line cook and she's the bartender.¬†

They moved away, then I moved away and we lost touch. I googled her out of curiosity one day. Turns out, the dad had hidden cameras in the bathroom to record his kids and their friends. He also distributed these on the internet. FBI got him by requesting a naked video of a female family member (his daughter/my friend) for ‚Äúverification‚Äù on an incest Kik group. The judge says he was the sickest individual they ever encountered. He is now rotting in federal prison for life. 

I cried so much when I learned this. I feel so bad for the kids and the mom who were completely blindsided by this. The kids adored their dad and he betrayed them in the most vile way possible. 

Btw, the victims were all minors. The footage raided had all been from their residence at that time (so not where I knew her from). There is no way of knowing when he started doing this. I‚Äôll always wonder if his crimes occurred when I knew her. I had several sleep overs at her house and ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner at a table with this pile of human garbage.

I honestly believe that society will begin to truly progress when everyone has the freedom to come forward with their stories of SA, from the smallest girl to the biggest, toughest man. Everyone deserves to talk about what was done to them.

He was kind of weird but it's a comic book store, everyone is kind of weird.  

The store eventually sold to another friend of mine who decided he wanted to do everything instead of letting us set up shop so I didn't talk to him for a few months.  I think maybe 6 months after the store changed hands I got a collection of cards I don't normally buy and gave him a call. No answer.  I ran into another friend of his that weekend and he told me he had been arrested and been charged with extortion.  

Apparently this dude would make accounts on various social media sites, flirt with girls, get them to send him nudes and then threaten them with their release unless they did things for him.  Since he did it online the government decided to make him an example for one of the first major cyber-extortion cases and he earned himself a healthy 17 and a half years for it. A few of the girls were 17 at the time so they stuck him with distribution of child pornography, extortion of a minor.

I say that because you are acknowledging a failing and vocalizing it.  It is a very vulnerable position to put yourself in and you are entirely at the mercy of the person to whom you are apologizing.  It requires the lowering of the ego, which is hard if not impossible for some people to do.

We were on an island and an unexpected change gave us about 4 days of free time and we couldn't leave, so we booked a a deep-sea fishing cruise; got two boats. It was fun and we caught a fuck ton of fish. Our boat got three or four, 6-foot Wahus, a large grouper, and a couple of barracudas. The other boat caught a *190-lb* bluefin tuna, plus some other fish.  

A nearby restaurant on the island would clean and cook any catches for you, all for only $15 seat and they served it up in every way imaginable.

I didn't really have a choice since that was the only protein available, so I just dove in and *loved it*, especially the tuna sashimi. Everything was crazy delicious, i liked the Cajun-style and the sashimi the most. It drove my ex nuts because she couldn't ever get me to try seafood but here I was, a now converted afficianado."

2025-08-14 19:01:27+00:00,"I was in the Army for 6 years back in 08-14. The benefits of service have been palpable. There still exists veterans preference in many ""civilian government"" positions, that I have personally benefited from.

The key thing to remember is, they need to take advantage of education opportunities while they are still in. I knew people who got bachelors degrees without even touching their GI Bills.

They also need to plan for the future BEFORE they exit the military. Going to school? Okay, what school, what major, when do you start, etc...getting a job after? Have you interviewed with the company, do you have a start date, etc...

I basically walked out the gate with no plan, so initially it was a struggle (and it didn't need to be).

I've heard talk about VA benefits getting cut. I haven't personally seen it. I know they've gotten rid of staff at VA hospital, the benefits so far remain intact. That would probably be very inadvisable to change Vets benefits.

Being in kinda sucked. I missed weddings, graduations, birthdays, holidays. You have to listen to people who sometimes are complete fucking idiots. My MOS/""job"" doesn't exactly transfer into the civilian world at all. But, I do have some of the most epic stories.

If I could do it again, I would probably try and choose a different job. I'd personally stay away from tech related jobs. I'd go toward the medical side (maybe a Medic, etc), even a wheeled vehicle mechanic...
Keep in mind it's a job you're going to have to do for at least 3-4 years. You can't quit if you don't like it and you typically can't change it until your contract is over.

As far as the current administration goes...he's a real loon. What he's going to do or not do is a serious wrinkle that should be considered...and I can't really answer that part of it...it's a risk for sure. But, I joined during the surge in Iraq so...

As far as what branch, go Coast Guard! Wish I'd even considered it..."

  I think medication would help but idk I just wanna get through this and I feel like if I figure out how to do it without medication I wont fall to addiction ever again, it's like the bus scenario I agree but if I was a hardcore hard drugs addict it would be even worse of addiction I would have to decline I feel like if I didn't want to introduce more problems I have to deal with later (extreme cravings)
  Often I think of a study I heard of idk where but with mice, it went something along the lines of when the mouse was alone and had nothing really except normal water and opioid water it would always choose the opioid water until it died, but when the opioid water was introduced into a ""mice utopia"" I guess you could say, noone overdosed, I reflect often on this study, I really should look into it more and similar studies but yea idk."

I think the USA is doing what it takes to be there years from now and that a better living Standard would be too expensive and offensive to your kind of capitalism.

For example: using religious terminology we can say you worship science.

I've learned that love as a whole is very rewarding and can sometimes be painful, not because of anything that people do, because even though I do a lot, I sometimes feel like I don't do enough to make the people I love happy. Its hard too, because my family has been taking advantage of me for years, and its my girl who's helping me see this and encouraging me to start my own life, and her support is making it possible to really change my mindset about things I previously would not have done because I didn't know any better. Without her, I would not be where I am confidence-wise today, that's a proven fact. All this to say, love is different for everyone, but for me it‚Äôs about support, compromise, and overall, being a team and working in the best interests of that team."

Gun control - you can't address the mental state because any such law is an infringement on the 2nd amendment, you also can't mandate training or continual recertification or lists of who owns guns or impose restrictions on things like bump-stocks, you can't even mention the bit that states its for a 'well regulated militia'  
  
Economics - which side notes the disparity between billionaires and the 99%?  Or even talks about it?

Once they were at a ""normal"" party with a bunch of those friends at one of their houses.  They were getting ready to leave as the crowd seemed like it was thinning out.  She went to the bathroom and opened a bedroom door to see if the host had put the coats in there and was instead met with the sight of 8-10 people screwing each other and not matched up in the couples as she knew them.

My friend had a lot of explaining to do on the ride home."

His head was under the tire, blood everywhere, and I kept driving because I was 16, only place closest was my high school, and nobody was there (before cell phones).

2025-08-14 19:05:47+00:00,"That‚Äôs a really good question.

I suppose the first book that comes to mind is ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert Sapolsky, as it presented the intersectionality of human psychology and evolutionary biology in a way that I had never before thought about, and I learned a great deal from it. I think a lot of the insights I gained from reading that book genuinely fuel my curiosity and desire to keep learning and studying the mind. It also showed me that a career in academia is probably what‚Äôs most desirable to me.

However, though not a book, Friedrich Nietzsche‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense‚Äù is probably the most important piece of writing I have ever read. I‚Äôve never read anything that has been so layered and detailed, yet so compact. Every time I reread the essay, I swear there is more I take away. Though certainly a bit of interpretation is required to understand what is being said, I largely think it is very accessible text that reveals so much about human society and language and the ways that we construct the world around us in a way that is relative to our perceptual constraints rather than in a way that is aligned with absolute truth and objective reality. This essay extends so far into the realms of linguistic anthropology and psychology that it‚Äôs hard to believe it precedes both fields

He was accused of taking upskirt photos of women at Walmart. Cops were called and confiscated his phone. Turns out it was true because they found a bunch of attempts and a video of him jerking off into women's underwear at that Walmart. 

and they found hundreds, if not thousands, of AI-generated CP, actual CP, and animal abuse photos and videos.

2025-08-14 19:06:41+00:00,"I had a manager we referred to as 'the tyrant.' She had previously been on the team for longer than anyone else (about 8 years) and basically was the Dwight Schrute of wanting a promotion and applying for any and every opportunity to take some kind of power role. When her manager finally got promoted she applied for her job and although her manager advised against it she got the team manager position. Per our department manager she 'showed she wanted it more than anyone.' Our team listened to those calls that were recorded for 'quality assurance.'

Here is the list of grievances against her in her first year:

* She would relay updates by walking among our cubicles screaming at the top of her lungs like a town cryer and if you didn't hear what she was saying because you were listening to a recorded call (you know you're job) you would be yelled at for being 'disrespectful' for asking her to repeat herself.
* Our top performer had previously been a team manager in the department and stepped down after having her daughter due to stress. She was FAR more knowledgeable and had over 20 years in the department under her belt. This made the manager insecure and one day after the girl corrected her on giving us incorrect information she handed her a white box and told her to pack her things. The girl called corporate HR and found out she was actually not fired and advised to return to work if she would like. She instead hired a lawyer and received a 3 year salary settlement. The manager still had her job.
* She would go through our desks at night and if you had any medication in there, prescription or not, she would throw it away. The next day you'd get spoken to about how 'poisonous' that is for your body and she'd try to get you to buy essential oils from the MLM she was in deep on. HR did not care.
* She also bragged about the fact that children's services was called on her because when her son broke his arm and they had to take him to the emergency room she got into a fight with the medical staff about giving him pain meds and not letting her put oil on him. He went into shock and she considered it a result of the peace that the 'scent of the oil' brought him.
* 3 people walked out tired of the power trip leaving us with 3 people to complete the same expected daily workload one of whom had only been on the team a few weeks and was still learning. I as a result took on 3xs my workload to help cover as much as I could. She asked me to do more work, and I told her I would try if I could. I was working non-stop, completing more than anyone else with the highest accuracy rate and they would not offer us OT to make up the difference so I was not going to work past my shift. I came in one day to her pulling me into a conference room to just scream at me for about 30 minutes and giving me a 'write up' that I needed to 'work harder.' She wouldn't define for me what that meant. HR confirmed there was no official write up on my file, but again would do nothing.
* Word got around the company and NO ONE would apply for our, internal hire only, team role so we could not back fill.
* On my 5 year anniversary I walked in and she said, 'wow 5 years surprised you'd made it this long.' I said 'you know what you're right.' I handed her my badge and walked out. She asked me where I planned to go and I said 'anywhere but here.'
* Last I heard she is still in that position and has not gone anywhere... that was 10 years ago."

2025-08-14 19:08:13+00:00,"This is an extremely niche response, and most people won‚Äôt identify with it, but I think that those who can will agree. 

I‚Äôve been saying for years that the most intimate thing that two people can do with their clothes on is break out a young horse. 

Hear me out. I‚Äôll describe it for those who don‚Äôt know. The first time a young horse has a rider on its back, typically two people are involved: the rider, and the ground person. At this point, the ground person should have done a considerable amount of ground work and desensitization with the horse to get them to the point of being ready to accept a rider. Contrary to what you see in cowboy movies, the first time a horse is ridden it should absolutely not act like a wild bronc, and the rider isn‚Äôt there to ride it out until the horse is exhausted and gives up. For the first few rides, the rider is literally just human shaped weight on the horse, and is totally at the mercy of the horse and the ground person. The rider has zero control whatsoever and is putting 100% of their trust in the ground person‚Äôs control of the horse based on the groundwork that has already been done. Of course, sometimes unexpected things happen and the horse could react fearfully to the situation. When this happens, it happens FAST and can be extremely dangerous for everyone involved. The ground person could get trampled, the rider could get thrown, the horse could bolt off, it could even rear up and flip over backwards on top of the rider. So both people have to be completely in tune with the horse and its body language, and also with each other and their respective body language. There usually isn‚Äôt time to vocalize anything before something goes wrong, it happens that fast. They essentially have to be able to communicate with each other without words while staying on the same page about what‚Äôs going on. 

When two people are so in tune with each other, it makes the process something beautiful. Like ballet. Effortless, seamless, graceful. You really learn a lot about the other person without speaking any words. 

On the contrary, when two people don‚Äôt work well together and aren‚Äôt in tune with each other, it can be a real clusterfuck"

In the case of matter disintegration and compilation, your original mind and body is essentially erased and a copy (from just before you get zapped) is built at the destination.

So in essence, you won't even achieve or enjoy what you set up to do, but your copy does. Quite a few games and novels bring this up. But yes, the Sun for me since there's no round trip."

This could be a flippant answer but it is not. I learned to make arrowheads in a four hour class, at the end of which I could produce the crudest, most lopsided and misshapen arrowhead imaginable. It was really fun.

Our hominid ancestors  made stone tools for three million years, or more. This is such a long time that the knowledge of making stone tools could have actually been encoded in our genome, except it wasn't. 

Hunting and gathering behavior is definitely encoded in our being.  From actual sport hunting, to games like Easter Egg hunts or geocacheing, we love searching for things that could be valuable once found. We are even entertained by finding Waldo. Hominids have been hunt√≠ng and gathering for a long, long time.  But flint knapping should be as core to our being. Try it if you can find a class It is fascinating."

2025-08-14 19:09:48+00:00,"I love him to bits! We had something similar. I lost weight, he gained. For a little bit he withdrew. Not because of the change in my body, but because he felt he wasn‚Äôt good enough anymore. It surprised me that men often feel pretty similar as women. They want to feel desired and wanted. Not just a pogo stick to bounce on. Try breaking the ice and see how he responds. Obviously it can‚Äôt all be on you all the time but maybe he‚Äôs just scared you‚Äôll reject him and that‚Äôs why he distanced himself. His hand on you at night suggests to me the desire is there. As ridiculous as my hub‚Äôs suggestion is, that actually did work. A little caressing, a little leg wrapping action, some nuzzling on his neck‚Ä¶then boom, hello monsieur. He was back and even more romantic than before. He needed me to initiate because of how self conscious he felt and sometimes words just aren‚Äôt enough. Think of his hand on you like he‚Äôs reaching out for help. He needs you to pull him back in. 

Obviously this could all be crap, there‚Äôs no way for me to know the intricacies of your relationship. But it‚Äôs a fairly harmless way to try. The worst that could happen is feeling disappointed and coming to the realization that something more is going on. Which is something that is better to realize sooner rather than later.

When I talk about physical addiction, I mean that you will have physical withdrawal symptoms should you stop taking the substance due to your body going into shock. Obviously, these symptoms vary depending on the person and how long they've been doing it/ how much their body has adapted to it. 

Long-time alcoholics can have seizures if they quit drinking suddenly. That's on the severe end, but some of the mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms overlap with sugar such as headaches, inability to sleep, trouble concentrating, irritability, and tremors."

I would sacrifice all of that for her to just touch me. I don't need her to buy me gifts, or make me dinners/lunches, or whatever. I just want her to touch me.  

I feel very ugly and undesirable. To the point I won't look at my body in the mirror. I can't stand to be naked, definitely not near her. She will be in the bathroom and I'll have to get in the shower and I do everything I can to try and makes sure she can't see me because I just feel ugly and unwanted. I will literally walk into the shower clothed and undress in there and toss my clothes over the barrier.

2025-08-14 19:12:43+00:00,"Do you mean why do they look different?  It's mostly because of the way the pelvis of your average women differs from your average man, which is because of the effect of sex hormones like testosterone.  More testosterone and less estrogen, and you get the kind of pelvis that is more typical of men.  Less testosterone and more estrogen, and you get the wider and more tilted kind of pelvis that is more typical of women.

  
(Fun fact: all medically normal human bodies produce both testosterone and estrogen; the sex-linked difference is in the *amounts* of each.)

  
There are other factors at play, like fat distribution, but it's mostly the skeletal structure."
